<h2>REGINALD BLAKE, FINANCIER AND CAD</h2>
<p>The advantage of literature over life is that its characters
are clearly defined, and act consistently.&nbsp; Nature, always
inartistic, takes pleasure in creating the impossible.&nbsp;
Reginald Blake was as typical a specimen of the well-bred cad as
one could hope to find between Piccadilly Circus and Hyde Park
Corner.&nbsp; Vicious without passion, and possessing brain
without mind, existence presented to him no difficulties, while
his pleasures brought him no pains.&nbsp; His morality was
bounded by the doctor on the one side, and the magistrate on the
other.&nbsp; Careful never to outrage the decrees of either, he
was at forty-five still healthy, though stout; and had achieved
the not too easy task of amassing a fortune while avoiding all
risk of Holloway.&nbsp; He and his wife, Edith (<i>n&eacute;e</i>
Eppington), were as ill-matched a couple as could be conceived by
any dramatist seeking material for a problem play.&nbsp; As they
stood before the altar on their wedding morn, they might have
been taken as symbolising satyr and saint.&nbsp; More than twenty
years his junior, beautiful with the beauty of a Raphael&rsquo;s
Madonna, his every touch of her seemed a sacrilege.&nbsp; Yet
once in his life Mr. Blake played the part of a great gentleman;
Mrs. Blake, on the same occasion, contenting herself with a
singularly mean <i>r&ocirc;le</i>&mdash;mean even for a woman in
love.</p>
<p>The affair, of course, had been a marriage of
convenience.&nbsp; Blake, to do him justice, had made no pretence
to anything beyond admiration and regard.&nbsp; Few things grow
monotonous sooner than irregularity.&nbsp; He would tickle his
jaded palate with respectability, and try for a change the
companionship of a good woman.&nbsp; The girl&rsquo;s face drew
him, as the moonlight holds a man who, bored by the noise, turns
from a heated room to press his forehead to the
window-pane.&nbsp; Accustomed to bid for what he wanted, he
offered his price.&nbsp; The Eppington family was poor and
numerous.&nbsp; The girl, bred up to the false notions of duty
inculcated by a narrow conventionality, and, feminine like, half
in love with martyrdom for its own sake, let her father bargain
for a higher price, and then sold herself.</p>
<p>To a drama of this description, a lover is necessary, if the
complications are to be of interest to the outside world.&nbsp;
Harry Sennett, a pleasant-looking enough young fellow, in spite
of his receding chin, was possessed, perhaps, of more good
intention than sense.&nbsp; Under the influence of Edith&rsquo;s
stronger character he was soon persuaded to acquiesce meekly in
the proposed arrangement.&nbsp; Both succeeded in convincing
themselves that they were acting nobly.&nbsp; The tone of the
farewell interview, arranged for the eve of the wedding, would
have been fit and proper to the occasion had Edith been a modern
Joan of Arc about to sacrifice her own happiness on the altar of
a great cause; as the girl was merely selling herself into ease
and luxury, for no higher motive than the desire to enable a
certain number of more or less worthy relatives to continue
living beyond their legitimate means, the sentiment was perhaps
exaggerated.&nbsp; Many tears were shed, and many everlasting
good-byes spoken, though, seeing that Edith&rsquo;s new home
would be only a few streets off, and that of necessity their
social set would continue to be the same, more experienced
persons might have counselled hope.&nbsp; Three months after the
marriage they found themselves side by side at the same
dinner-table; and after a little melodramatic fencing with what
they were pleased to regard as fate, they accommodated themselves
to the customary positions.</p>
<p>Blake was quite aware that Sennett had been Edith&rsquo;s
lover.&nbsp; So had half a dozen other men, some younger, some
older than himself.&nbsp; He felt no more embarrassment at
meeting them than, standing on the pavement outside the Stock
Exchange, he would have experienced greeting his brother jobbers
after a settling day that had transferred a fortune from their
hands into his.&nbsp; Sennett, in particular, he liked and
encouraged.&nbsp; Our whole social system, always a mystery to
the philosopher, owes its existence to the fact that few men and
women possess sufficient intelligence to be interesting to
themselves.&nbsp; Blake liked company, but not much company liked
Blake.&nbsp; Young Sennett, however, could always be relied upon
to break the tediousness of the domestic dialogue.&nbsp; A common
love of sport drew the two men together.&nbsp; Most of us improve
upon closer knowledge, and so they came to find good in one
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the man you ought to have married,&rdquo; said
Blake one night to his wife, half laughingly, half seriously, as
they sat alone, listening to Sennett&rsquo;s departing footsteps
echoing upon the deserted pavement.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a
good fellow&mdash;not a mere money-grubbing machine like
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a week later Sennett, sitting alone with Edith, suddenly
broke out with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a better man than I am, with all my
high-falutin&rsquo; talk, and, upon my soul, he loves you.&nbsp;
Shall I go abroad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill myself,&rdquo; replied the other, with a laugh,
&ldquo;or run away with the first man that asked me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Sennett stayed on.</p>
<p>Blake himself had made the path easy to them.&nbsp; There was
little need for either fear or caution.&nbsp; Indeed, their
safest course lay in recklessness, and they took it.&nbsp; To
Sennett the house was always open.&nbsp; It was Blake himself
who, when unable to accompany his wife, would suggest Sennett as
a substitute.&nbsp; Club friends shrugged their shoulders.&nbsp;
Was the man completely under his wife&rsquo;s thumb; or, tired of
her, was he playing some devil&rsquo;s game of his own?&nbsp; To
most of his acquaintances the latter explanation seemed the more
plausible.</p>
<p>The gossip, in due course, reached the parental home.&nbsp;
Mrs. Eppington shook the vials of her wrath over the head of her
son-in-law.&nbsp; The father, always a cautious man, felt
inclined to blame his child for her want of prudence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll ruin everything,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why the devil can&rsquo;t she be careful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the man is deliberately plotting to get rid
of her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Eppington.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall tell him
plainly what I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fool, Hannah,&rdquo; replied her
husband, allowing himself the licence of the domestic
hearth.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you are right, you will only precipitate
matters; if you are wrong, you will tell him what there is no
need for him to know.&nbsp; Leave the matter to me.&nbsp; I can
sound him without giving anything away, and meanwhile you talk to
Edith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So matters were arranged, but the interview between mother and
daughter hardly improved the position.&nbsp; Mrs. Eppington was
conventionally moral; Edith had been thinking for herself, and
thinking in a bad atmosphere.&nbsp; Mrs. Eppington, grew angry at
the girl&rsquo;s callousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you no sense of shame?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had once,&rdquo; was Edith&rsquo;s reply,
&ldquo;before I came to live here.&nbsp; Do you know what this
house is for me, with its gilded mirrors, its couches, its soft
carpets?&nbsp; Do you know what I am, and have been for two
years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elder woman rose, with a frightened pleading look upon her
face, and the other stopped and turned away towards the
window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all thought it for the best,&rdquo; continued Mrs.
Eppington meekly.</p>
<p>The girl spoke wearily without looking round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! every silly thing that was ever done, was done for
the best.&nbsp; <i>I</i> thought it would be for the best,
myself.&nbsp; Everything would be so simple if only we were not
alive.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk any more.&nbsp; All you
can say is quite right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silence continued for a while, the Dresden-china clock on
the mantelpiece ticking louder and louder as if to say, &ldquo;I,
Time, am here.&nbsp; Do not make your plans forgetting me, little
mortals; I change your thoughts and wills.&nbsp; You are but my
puppets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what do you intend to do?&rdquo; demanded Mrs.
Eppington at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intend!&nbsp; Oh, the right thing of course.&nbsp; We
all intend that.&nbsp; I shall send Harry away with a few
well-chosen words of farewell, learn to love my husband and
settle down to a life of quiet domestic bliss.&nbsp; Oh,
it&rsquo;s easy enough to intend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s face wrinkled with a laugh that aged
her.&nbsp; In that moment it was a hard, evil face, and with a
pang the elder woman thought of that other face, so like, yet so
unlike&mdash;the sweet pure face of a girl that had given to a
sordid home its one touch of nobility.&nbsp; As under the
lightning&rsquo;s flash we see the whole arc of the horizon, so
Mrs. Eppington looked and saw her child&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; The
gilded, over-furnished room vanished.&nbsp; She and a big-eyed,
fair-haired child, the only one of her children she had ever
understood, were playing wonderful games in the twilight among
the shadows of a tiny attic.&nbsp; Now she was the wolf,
devouring Edith, who was Red Riding Hood, with kisses.&nbsp; Now
Cinderella&rsquo;s prince, now both her wicked sisters.&nbsp; But
in the favourite game of all, Mrs. Eppington was a beautiful
princess, bewitched by a wicked dragon, so that she seemed to be
an old, worn woman.&nbsp; But curly-headed Edith fought the
dragon, represented by the three-legged rocking-horse, and slew
him with much shouting and the toasting-fork.&nbsp; Then Mrs.
Eppington became again a beautiful princess, and went away with
Edith back to her own people.</p>
<p>In this twilight hour the misbehaviour of the
&ldquo;General,&rdquo; the importunity of the family butcher, and
the airs assumed by cousin Jane, who kept two servants, were
forgotten.</p>
<p>The games ended.&nbsp; The little curly head would be laid
against her breast &ldquo;for five minutes&rsquo; love,&rdquo;
while the restless little brain framed the endless question that
children are for ever asking in all its thousand forms,
&ldquo;What is life, mother?&nbsp; I am very little, and I think,
and think, until I grow frightened.&nbsp; Oh, mother, tell me,
what is life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had she dealt with these questions wisely?&nbsp; Might it not
have been better to have treated them more seriously?&nbsp; Could
life after all be ruled by maxims learned from copy-books?&nbsp;
She had answered as she had been answered in her own far-back
days of questioning.&nbsp; Might it not have been better had she
thought for herself?</p>
<p>Suddenly Edith was kneeling on the floor beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try to be good, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the old baby cry, the cry of us all, children that we
are, till mother Nature kisses us and bids us go to sleep.</p>
<p>Their arms were round each other now, and so they sat, mother
and child once more.&nbsp; And the twilight of the old attic,
creeping westward from the east, found them again.</p>
<p>The masculine duet had more result, but was not conducted with
the <i>finesse</i> that Mr. Eppington, who prided himself on his
diplomacy, had intended.&nbsp; Indeed, so evidently ill at ease
was that gentleman, when the moment came for talk, and so
palpably were his pointless remarks mere efforts to delay an
unpleasant subject, that Blake, always direct bluntly though not
ill-naturedly asked him, &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Eppington was disconcerted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that&mdash;at least that&rsquo;s not
what I have come about,&rdquo; he answered confusedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you come about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inwardly Mr. Eppington cursed himself for a fool, for the
which he was perhaps not altogether without excuse.&nbsp; He had
meant to act the part of a clever counsel, acquiring information
while giving none; by a blunder, he found himself in the
witness-box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing, nothing,&rdquo; was the feeble response,
&ldquo;merely looked in to see how Edith was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much the same as at dinner last night, when you were
here,&rdquo; answered Blake.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, out with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed the best course now, and Mr. Eppington took the
plunge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; he said, unconsciously
glancing round the room to be sure they were alone, &ldquo;that
young Sennett is a little too much about the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, we know it is all right&mdash;as nice a
young fellow as ever lived&mdash;and Edith&mdash;and all
that.&nbsp; Of course, it&rsquo;s absurd, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, people will talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>Blake rose.&nbsp; He had an ugly look when angry, and his
language was apt to be coarse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them to mind their own business, and leave me and
my wife alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was the sense of what he said;
he expressed himself at greater length, and in stronger
language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Blake,&rdquo; urged Mr. Eppington,
&ldquo;for your own sake, is it wise?&nbsp; There was a sort of
boy and girl attachment between them&mdash;nothing of any moment,
but all that gives colour to gossip.&nbsp; Forgive me, but I am
her father; I do not like to hear my child talked
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t open your ears to the chatter of a
pack of fools,&rdquo; replied his son-in-law roughly.&nbsp; But
the next instant a softer expression passed over his face, and he
laid his hand on the older man&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps there are many more, but there&rsquo;s one good
woman in the world,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s your
daughter.&nbsp; Come and tell me that the Bank of England is
getting shaky on its legs, and I&rsquo;ll listen to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the stronger the faith, the deeper strike the roots of
suspicion.&nbsp; Blake said no further word on the subject, and
Sennett was as welcome as before.&nbsp; But Edith, looking up
suddenly, would sometimes find her husband&rsquo;s eyes fixed on
her with a troubled look as of some dumb creature trying to
understand; and often he would slip out of the house of an
evening by himself, returning home hours afterwards, tired and
mud-stained.</p>
<p>He made attempts to show his affection.&nbsp; This was the
most fatal thing he could have done.&nbsp; Ill-temper,
ill-treatment even, she might have borne.&nbsp; His clumsy
caresses, his foolish, halting words of tenderness became a
horror to her.&nbsp; She wondered whether to laugh or to strike
at his upturned face.&nbsp; His tactless devotion filled her life
as with some sickly perfume, stifling her.&nbsp; If only she
could be by herself for a little while to think!&nbsp; But he was
with her night and day.&nbsp; There were times when, as he would
cross the room towards her, he grew monstrous until he towered
above her, a formless thing such as children dream of.&nbsp; And
she would sit with her lips tight pressed, clutching the chair
lest she should start up screaming.</p>
<p>Her only thought was to escape from him.&nbsp; One day she
hastily packed a few necessaries in a small hand-bag and crept
unperceived from the house.&nbsp; She drove to Charing Cross, but
the Continental Express did not leave for an hour, and she had
time to think.</p>
<p>Of what use was it?&nbsp; Her slender stock of money would
soon be gone; how could she live?&nbsp; He would find her and
follow her.&nbsp; It was all so hopeless!</p>
<p>Suddenly a fierce desire of life seized hold of her, the angry
answer of her young blood to despair.&nbsp; Why should she die,
never having known what it was to live?&nbsp; Why should she
prostrate herself before this juggernaut of other people&rsquo;s
respectability?&nbsp; Joy called to her; only her own cowardice
stayed her from stretching forth her hand and gathering it.&nbsp;
She returned home a different woman, for hope had come to
her.</p>
<p>A week later the butler entered the dining room, and handed
Blake a letter addressed to him in his wife&rsquo;s
handwriting.&nbsp; He took it without a word, as though he had
been expecting it.&nbsp; It simply told him that she had left him
for ever.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The world is small, and money commands many services.&nbsp;
Sennett had gone out for a stroll; Edith was left in the tiny
<i>salon</i> of their <i>appartement</i> at F&eacute;camp.&nbsp;
It was the third day of their arrival in the town.&nbsp; The door
was opened and closed, and Blake stood before her.</p>
<p>She rose frightened, but by a motion he reassured her.&nbsp;
There was a quiet dignity about the man that was strange to
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why have you followed me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to return home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must be
mad.&nbsp; Do you not know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He interrupted her vehemently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know
nothing.&nbsp; I wish to know nothing.&nbsp; Go back to London at
once.&nbsp; I have made everything right; no one suspects.&nbsp;
I shall not be there; you will never see me again, and you will
have an opportunity of undoing your mistake&mdash;our
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She listened.&nbsp; Hers was not a great nature, and the
desire to obtain happiness without paying the price was strong
upon her.&nbsp; As for his good name, what could that matter? he
urged.&nbsp; People would only say that he had gone back to the
evil from which he had emerged, and few would be surprised.&nbsp;
His life would go on much as it had done, and she would only be
pitied.</p>
<p>She quite understood his plan; it seemed mean of her to accept
his proposal, and she argued feebly against it.&nbsp; But he
overcame all her objections.&nbsp; For his own sake, he told her,
he would prefer the scandal to be connected with his name rather
than with that of his wife.&nbsp; As he unfolded his scheme, she
began to feel that in acquiescing she was conferring a
favour.&nbsp; It was not the first deception he had arranged for
the public, and he appeared to be half in love with his own
cleverness.&nbsp; She even found herself laughing at his mimicry
of what this acquaintance and that would say.&nbsp; Her spirits
rose; the play that might have been a painful drama seemed
turning out an amusing farce.</p>
<p>The thing settled, he rose to go, and held out his hand.&nbsp;
As she looked up into his face, something about the line of his
lips smote upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be well rid of me,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have brought you nothing but trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, trouble,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;If that
were all!&nbsp; A man can bear trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>His eyes travelled aimlessly about the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
taught me a lot of things when I was a boy,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;my mother and others&mdash;they meant well&mdash;which as
I grew older I discovered to be lies; and so I came to think that
nothing good was true, and that everything and everybody was
evil.&nbsp; And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wandering eyes came round to her and he broke off
abruptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said, and the next
moment he was gone.</p>
<p>She sat wondering for a while what he had meant.&nbsp; Then
Sennett returned, and the words went out of her head.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>A good deal of sympathy was felt for Mrs. Blake.&nbsp; The man
had a charming wife; he might have kept straight; but as his
friends added, &ldquo;Blake always was a cad.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>AN ITEM OF FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE</h2>
<p>Speaking personally, I do not like the Countess of ---.&nbsp;
She is not the type of woman I could love.&nbsp; I hesitate the
less giving expression to this sentiment by reason of the
conviction that the Countess of --- would not be unduly depressed
even were the fact to reach her ears.&nbsp; I cannot conceive the
Countess of ---&rsquo;s being troubled by the opinion concerning
her of any being, human or divine, other than the Countess of
---.</p>
<p>But to be honest, I must admit that for the Earl of --- she
makes an ideal wife.&nbsp; She rules him as she rules all others,
relations and retainers, from the curate to the dowager, but the
rod, though firmly held, is wielded with justice and kindly
intent.&nbsp; Nor is it possible to imagine the Earl of
---&rsquo;s living as contentedly as he does with any partner of
a less dominating turn of mind.&nbsp; He is one of those
weak-headed, strong-limbed, good-natured, childish men, born to
be guided in all matters, from the tying of a neck-cloth to the
choice of a political party, by their women folk.&nbsp; Such men
are in clover when their proprietor happens to be a good and
sensible woman, but are to be pitied when they get into the hands
of the selfish or the foolish.&nbsp; As very young men, they too
often fall victims to bad-tempered chorus girls or to middle-aged
matrons of the class from which Pope judged all womankind.&nbsp;
They make capital husbands when well managed; treated badly, they
say little, but set to work, after the manner of a dissatisfied
cat, to find a kinder mistress, generally succeeding.&nbsp; The
Earl of --- adored his wife, deeming himself the most fortunate
of husbands, and better testimonial than such no wife should hope
for.&nbsp; Till the day she snatched him away from all other
competitors, and claimed him for her own, he had obeyed his
mother with a dutifulness bordering on folly.&nbsp; Were the
countess to die to-morrow, he would be unable to tell you his
mind on any single subject until his eldest daughter and his
still unmarried sister, ladies both of strong character,
attracted towards one another by a mutual antagonism, had settled
between themselves which was to be mistress of him and of his
house.</p>
<p>However, there is little fear (bar accidents) but that my
friend the countess will continue to direct the hereditary vote
of the Earl of --- towards the goal of common sense and public
good, guide his social policy with judgment and kindness, and
manage his estates with prudence and economy for many years to
come.&nbsp; She is a hearty, vigorous lady, of generous
proportions, with the blood of sturdy forebears in her veins, and
one who takes the same excellent good care of herself that she
bestows on all others dependent upon her guidance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said the doctor&mdash;we were dining
with the doctor in homely fashion, and our wives had adjourned to
the drawing-room to discuss servants and husbands and other
domestic matters with greater freedom, leaving us to the claret
and the twilight&mdash;&ldquo;I remember when we had the cholera
in the village&mdash;it must be twenty years ago now&mdash;that
woman gave up the London season to stay down here and take the
whole burden of the trouble upon her own shoulders.&nbsp; I do
not feel any call to praise her; she liked the work, and she was
in her element, but it was good work for all that.&nbsp; She had
no fear.&nbsp; She would carry the children in her arms if time
pressed and the little ambulance was not at hand.&nbsp; I have
known her sit all night in a room not twelve feet square, between
a dying man and his dying wife.&nbsp; But the thing never touched
her.&nbsp; Six years ago we had the small-pox, and she went all
through that in just the same way.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe
she has ever had a day&rsquo;s illness in her life.&nbsp; She
will be physicking this parish when my bones are rattling in my
coffin, and she will be laying down the laws of literature long
after your statue has become a familiar ornament of Westminster
Abbey.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a wonderful woman, but a trifle
masterful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed, but I detected a touch of irritation in his
voice.&nbsp; My host looked a man wishful to be masterful
himself.&nbsp; I do not think he quite relished the calm way in
which this grand dame took possession of all things around her,
himself and his work included.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear the story of the marriage?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;whose marriage?&nbsp; The
earl&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should call it the countess&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was the gossip of the county when I
first came here, but other curious things have happened among us
to push it gradually out of memory.&nbsp; Most people, I really
believe, have quite forgotten that the Countess of --- once
served behind a baker&rsquo;s counter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; The
remark, I admit, sounds weak when written down; the most natural
remarks always do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; said the doctor,
&ldquo;though she does not suggest the shop-girl, does she?&nbsp;
But then I have known countesses, descended in a direct line from
William the Conqueror, who did, so things balance one
another.&nbsp; Mary, Countess of ---, was, thirty years ago, Mary
Sewell, daughter of a Taunton linen-draper.&nbsp; The business,
profitable enough as country businesses go, was inadequate for
the needs of the Sewell family, consisting, as I believe it did,
of seven boys and eight girls.&nbsp; Mary, the youngest, as soon
as her brief schooling was over, had to shift for herself.&nbsp;
She seems to have tried her hand at one or two things, finally
taking service with a cousin, a baker and confectioner, who was
doing well in Oxford Street.&nbsp; She must have been a
remarkably attractive girl; she&rsquo;s a handsome woman
now.&nbsp; I can picture that soft creamy skin when it was fresh
and smooth, and the West of England girls run naturally to
dimples and eyes that glisten as though they had been just washed
in morning dew.&nbsp; The shop did a good trade in ladies&rsquo;
lunches&mdash;it was the glass of sherry and sweet biscuit
period.&nbsp; I expect they dressed her in some neat-fitting grey
or black dress, with short sleeves, showing her plump arms, and
that she flitted around the marble-topped tables, smiling, and
looking cool and sweet.&nbsp; There the present Earl of ---, then
young Lord C---, fresh from Oxford, and new to the dangers of
London bachelordom, first saw her.&nbsp; He had accompanied some
female relatives to the photographer&rsquo;s, and, hotels and
restaurants being deemed impossible in those days for ladies, had
taken them to Sewell&rsquo;s to lunch.&nbsp; Mary Sewell waited
upon the party; and now as many of that party as are above ground
wait upon Mary Sewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He showed good sense in marrying her,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;I admire him for it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The doctor&rsquo;s
sixty-four Lafitte was excellent.&nbsp; I felt charitably
inclined towards all men and women, even towards earls and
countesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he had much to do with it,&rdquo;
laughed the doctor, &ldquo;beyond being, like Barkis,
&lsquo;willing.&rsquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a queer story; some
people profess not to believe it, but those who know her ladyship
best think it is just the story that must be true, because it is
so characteristic of her.&nbsp; And besides, I happen to know
that it is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to hear it,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to tell it you,&rdquo; said the doctor,
lighting a fresh cigar, and pushing the box towards me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>I will leave you to imagine the lad&rsquo;s suddenly developed
appetite for decantered sherry at sixpence a glass, and the
familiar currant bun of our youth.&nbsp; He lunched at
Sewell&rsquo;s shop, he tea&rsquo;d at Sewell&rsquo;s,
occasionally he dined at Sewell&rsquo;s, off cutlets, followed by
assorted pastry.&nbsp; Possibly, merely from fear lest the affair
should reach his mother&rsquo;s ears, for he was neither
worldly-wise nor vicious, he made love to Mary under an assumed
name; and to do the girl justice, it must be remembered that she
fell in love with and agreed to marry plain Mr. John Robinson,
son of a colonial merchant, a gentleman, as she must have seen,
and a young man of easy means, but of a position not so very much
superior to her own.&nbsp; The first intimation she received that
her lover was none other than Lord C---, the future Earl of ---,
was vouchsafed her during a painful interview with his
lordship&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew it, madam,&rdquo; asserted Mary, standing
by the window of the drawing-room above the shop, &ldquo;upon my
word of honour, I never knew it&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; answered her ladyship coldly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Would you have refused him if you had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell,&rdquo; was the girl&rsquo;s answer;
&ldquo;it would have been different from the beginning.&nbsp; He
courted me and asked me to be his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t go into all that,&rdquo; interrupted the
other; &ldquo;I am not here to defend him.&nbsp; I do not say he
acted well.&nbsp; The question is, how much will compensate you
for your natural disappointment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her ladyship prided herself upon her bluntness and
practicability.&nbsp; As she spoke she took her cheque-book out
of her reticule, and, opening it, dipped her pen into the
ink.&nbsp; I am inclined to think that the flutter of that
cheque-book was her ladyship&rsquo;s mistake.&nbsp; The girl had
common sense, and must have seen the difficulties in the way of a
marriage between the heir to an earldom and a
linen-draper&rsquo;s daughter; and had the old lady been a person
of discernment, the interview might have ended more to her
satisfaction.&nbsp; She made the error of judging the world by
one standard, forgetting there are individualities.&nbsp; Mary
Sewell came from a West of England stock that, in the days of
Drake and Frobisher, had given more than one able-bodied pirate
to the service of the country, and that insult of the cheque-book
put the fight into her.&nbsp; Her lips closed with a little snap,
and the fear fell from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry I don&rsquo;t see my way to obliging your
ladyship,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, girl?&rdquo; asked the elder
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to be disappointed,&rdquo; answered
the girl, but she spoke quietly and respectfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
have pledged our word to one another.&nbsp; If he is a gentleman,
as I know he is, he will keep his, and I shall keep
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then her ladyship began to talk reason, as people do when it
is too late.&nbsp; She pointed out to the girl the difference of
social position, and explained to her the miseries that come from
marrying out of one&rsquo;s station.&nbsp; But the girl by this
time had got over her surprise, and perhaps had begun to reflect
that, in any case, a countess-ship was worth fighting for.&nbsp;
The best of women are influenced by such considerations.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a lady, I know,&rdquo; she replied quietly,
&ldquo;but my people have always been honest folk, well known,
and I shall try to learn.&nbsp; I am not wishing to speak
disrespectfully of my betters, but I was in service before I came
here, ma&rsquo;am, as lady&rsquo;s maid, in a place where I saw
much of what is called Society.&nbsp; I think I can be as good a
lady as some I know, if not better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The countess began to grow angry again.&nbsp; &ldquo;And who
do you think will receive you?&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;a girl
who has served in a pastry-cook&rsquo;s shop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady L--- came from behind the bar,&rdquo; Mary
answered, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s not much better.&nbsp; And the
Duchess of C---, I have heard, was a ballet girl, but nobody
seems to remember it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think the people whose
opinion is worth having will object to me for very
long.&rdquo;&nbsp; The girl was beginning rather to enjoy the
contest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You profess to love my son,&rdquo; cried the countess
fiercely, &ldquo;and you are going to ruin his life.&nbsp; You
will drag him down to your own level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl must have looked rather fine at that moment, I should
dearly love to have been present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no dragging down, my lady,&rdquo; she
replied, &ldquo;on either side.&nbsp; I do love your son very
dearly.&nbsp; He is one of the kindest and best of
gentlemen.&nbsp; But I am not blind, and whatever amount of
cleverness there may be between us belongs chiefly to me.&nbsp; I
shall make it my duty to fit myself for the position of his wife,
and to help him in his work.&nbsp; You need not fear, my lady, I
shall be a good wife to him, and he shall never regret it.&nbsp;
You might find him a richer wife, a better educated wife, but you
will never find him a wife who will be more devoted to him and to
his interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That practically brought the scene to a close.&nbsp; The
countess had sense enough to see that she was only losing ground
by argument.&nbsp; She rose and replaced her cheque-book in her
bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, my good girl, you must be mad,&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;if you will not allow me to do anything for you,
there&rsquo;s an end to the matter.&nbsp; I did not come here to
quarrel with you.&nbsp; My son knows his duty to me and to his
family.&nbsp; You must take your own course, and I must take
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, my lady,&rdquo; said Mary Sewell, holding
the door open for her ladyship to pass out, &ldquo;we shall see
who wins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But however brave a front Mary Sewell may have maintained
before the enemy, I expect she felt pretty limp when thinking
matters calmly over after her ladyship&rsquo;s departure.&nbsp;
She knew her lover well enough to guess that he would be as wax
in the firm hands of his mother, while she herself would not have
a chance of opposing her influence against those seeking to draw
him away from her.&nbsp; Once again she read through the few
schoolboy letters he had written her, and then looked up at the
framed photograph that hung above the mantelpiece of her little
bedroom.&nbsp; The face was that of a frank, pleasant-looking
young fellow, lightened by eyes somewhat large for a man, but
spoiled by a painfully weak mouth.&nbsp; The more Mary Sewell
thought, the more sure she felt in her own mind that he loved
her, and had meant honestly by her.&nbsp; Did the matter rest
with him, she might reckon on being the future Countess of ---,
but, unfortunately for her, the person to be considered was not
Lord C---, but the present Countess of ---.&nbsp; From childhood,
through boyhood, into manhood it had never once occurred to Lord
C--- to dispute a single command of his mother&rsquo;s, and his
was not the type of brain to readily receive new ideas.&nbsp; If
she was to win in the unequal contest it would have to be by art,
not by strength.&nbsp; She sat down and wrote a letter which
under all the circumstances was a model of diplomacy.&nbsp; She
knew that it would be read by the countess, and, writing it, she
kept both mother and son in mind.&nbsp; She made no reproaches,
and indulged in but little sentiment.&nbsp; It was the letter of
a woman who could claim rights, but who asked only for
courtesy.&nbsp; It stated her wish to see him alone and obtain
from his own lips the assurance that he wished their engagement
to cease.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not fear,&rdquo; Mary Sewell wrote,
&ldquo;that I shall be any annoyance to you.&nbsp; My own pride
would not let me urge you to marry me against your desire, and I
care for you too much to cause you any pain.&nbsp; Assure me with
your own lips that you wish our engagement to be at an end, and I
shall release you without another word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The family were in town, and Mary sent her letter by a trusty
hand.&nbsp; The countess read it with huge satisfaction, and,
re-sealing it, gave it herself into her son&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp;
It promised a happy solution of the problem.&nbsp; In
imagination, she had all the night been listening to a vulgar
breach of promise case.&nbsp; She herself had been submitted to a
most annoying cross-examination by a pert barrister.&nbsp; Her
son&rsquo;s assumption of the name of Robinson had been
misunderstood and severely commented upon by the judge.&nbsp; A
sympathetic jury had awarded thumping damages, and for the next
six months the family title would be a peg on which music-hall
singers and comic journalists would hang their ribald
jokes.&nbsp; Lord C--- read the letter, flushed, and dutifully
handed it back to his mother.&nbsp; She made pretence to read it
as for the first time, and counselled him to accord the
interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so glad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that the girl is
taking the matter sensibly.&nbsp; We must really do something for
her in the future, when everything is settled.&nbsp; Let her ask
for me, and then the servants will fancy she&rsquo;s a
lady&rsquo;s maid or something of that sort, come after a place,
and won&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that evening Mary Sewell, addressed by the butler as
&ldquo;young woman,&rdquo; was ushered into the small
drawing-room that connects the library of No. --- Grosvenor
Square with the other reception rooms.&nbsp; The countess, now
all amiability, rose to meet her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son will be here in a moment,&rdquo; she explained,
&ldquo;he has informed me of the purport of your letter.&nbsp;
Believe me, my dear Miss Sewell, no one can regret his
thoughtless conduct more than I do.&nbsp; But young men will be
young men, and they do not stop to reflect that what may be a
joke to them may be taken quite seriously by others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t regard the matter as a joke, my
lady,&rdquo; replied Mary somewhat curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, my dear,&rdquo; added the countess,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.&nbsp; It was very
wrong of him altogether.&nbsp; But with your pretty face, you
will not, I am sure, have long to wait for a husband; we must see
what we can do for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The countess certainly lacked tact; it must have handicapped
her exceedingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; answered the girl, &ldquo;but I
prefer to choose my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately&mdash;or the interview might have ended in another
quarrel&mdash;the cause of all the trouble at this moment entered
the room, and the countess, whispering a few final words of
instruction to him as she passed out, left them together.</p>
<p>Mary took a chair in the centre of the room, at equal distance
from both doors.&nbsp; Lord C---, finding any sort of a seat
uncomfortable under the circumstances, preferred to stand with
his back to the mantelpiece.&nbsp; Dead silence was maintained
for a few seconds, and then Mary, drawing the daintiest of
handkerchiefs from her pocket, began to cry.&nbsp; The countess
must have been a poor diplomatist, or she might have thought of
this; or she may have remembered her own appearance on the rare
occasions when she herself, a big, raw-boned girl, had attempted
the softening influence of tears, and have attached little
importance to the possibility.&nbsp; But when these soft, dimpled
women cry, and cry quietly, it is another matter.&nbsp; Their
eyes grow brighter, and the tears, few and far between, lie like
dewdrops on a rose leaf.</p>
<p>Lord C--- was as tender-hearted a lout as ever lived.&nbsp; In
a moment he was on his knees with his arm round the girl&rsquo;s
waist, pouring out such halting words of love and devotion as
came to his unready brain, cursing his fate, his earldom, and his
mother, and assuring Mary that his only chance of happiness lay
in his making her his countess.&nbsp; Had Mary liked to say the
word at that moment, he would have caught her to his arms, and
defied the whole world&mdash;for the time being.&nbsp; But Mary
was a very practical young woman, and there are difficulties in
the way of handling a lover, who, however ready he may be to do
your bidding so long as your eyes are upon him, is liable to be
turned from his purpose so soon as another influence is
substituted for your own.&nbsp; His lordship suggested an
immediate secret marriage.&nbsp; But you cannot run out into the
street, knock up a clergyman, and get married on the spot, and
Mary knew that the moment she was gone his lordship&rsquo;s will
would revert to his mother&rsquo;s keeping.&nbsp; Then his
lordship suggested flight, but flight requires money, and the
countess knew enough to keep his lordship&rsquo;s purse in her
own hands.&nbsp; Despair seized upon his lordship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;it will end
in my marrying her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s she?&rdquo; exclaimed Mary somewhat
quickly.</p>
<p>His lordship explained the position.&nbsp; The family estates
were heavily encumbered.&nbsp; It was deemed advisable that his
lordship should marry Money, and Money, in the person of the only
daughter of rich and ambitious parvenus, had offered
itself&mdash;or, to speak more correctly, had been offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s she like?&rdquo; asked Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s nice enough,&rdquo; was the reply,
&ldquo;only I don&rsquo;t care for her and she doesn&rsquo;t care
for me.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t be much fun for either of us,&rdquo;
and his lordship laughed dismally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know she doesn&rsquo;t care for you?&rdquo;
asked Mary.&nbsp; A woman may be critical of her lover&rsquo;s
shortcomings, but at the very least he is good enough for every
other woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she happens to care for somebody else,&rdquo;
answered his lordship, &ldquo;she told me so herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That would account for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is she willing to marry you?&rdquo; inquired
Mary.</p>
<p>His lordship shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you know, her people want it,&rdquo; he
replied.</p>
<p>In spite of her trouble, the girl could not help a
laugh.&nbsp; These young swells seemed to have but small wills of
their own.&nbsp; Her ladyship, on the other side of the door,
grew nervous.&nbsp; It was the only sound she had been able to
hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s deuced awkward,&rdquo; explained his
lordship, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re&mdash;well, when you are
anybody, you know.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t do as you like.&nbsp;
Things are expected of you, and there&rsquo;s such a lot to be
considered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary rose and clasped her pretty dimpled hands, from which she
had drawn her gloves, behind his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do love me, Jack?&rdquo; she said, looking up into
his face.</p>
<p>For answer the lad hugged her to him very tightly, and there
were tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Mary,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;if I could
only get rid of my position, and settle down with you as a
country gentleman, I&rsquo;d do it to-morrow.&nbsp; Damn the
title, it&rsquo;s going to be the curse of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps in that moment Mary also wished that the title were at
the bottom of the sea, and that her lover were only the plain Mr.
John Robinson she had thought him.&nbsp; These big, stupid men
are often very loveable in spite of, or because of their
weakness.&nbsp; They appeal to the mother side of a woman&rsquo;s
heart, and that is the biggest side in all good women.</p>
<p>Suddenly however, the door opened.&nbsp; The countess
appeared, and sentiment flew out.&nbsp; Lord C---, releasing
Mary, sprang back, looking like a guilty school-boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard Miss Sewell go out,&rdquo; said her
ladyship in the icy tones that had never lost their power of
making her son&rsquo;s heart freeze within him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
want to see you when you are free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be long,&rdquo; stammered his
lordship.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mary&mdash;Miss Sewell is just
going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary waited without moving until the countess had left and
closed the door behind her.&nbsp; Then she turned to her lover
and spoke in quick, low tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me her address&mdash;the girl they want you to
marry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; asked his
lordship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered the girl,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m going to see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She scribbled the name down, and then said, looking the boy
squarely in the face:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me frankly, Jack, do you want to marry me, or do
you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I do, Mary,&rdquo; he answered, and his eyes
spoke stronger than his words.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I weren&rsquo;t a
silly ass, there would be none of this trouble.&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t know how it is; I say to myself I&rsquo;ll do, a
thing, but the mater talks and talks and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; interrupted Mary with a smile.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t argue with her, fall in with all her views,
and pretend to agree with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you could only think of some plan,&rdquo; said his
lordship, catching at the hope of her words, &ldquo;you are so
clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to try,&rdquo; answered Mary, &ldquo;and if
I fail, you must run off with me, even if you have to do it right
before your mother&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What she meant was, &ldquo;I shall have to run off with
you,&rdquo; but she thought it better to put it the other way
about.</p>
<p>Mary found her involuntary rival a meek, gentle little lady,
as much under the influence of her blustering father as was Lord
C--- under that of his mother.&nbsp; What took place at the
interview one can only surmise; but certain it is that the two
girls, each for her own ends, undertook to aid and abet one
another.</p>
<p>Much to the surprised delight of their respective parents,
there came about a change in the attitude hitherto assumed
towards one another by Miss Clementina Hodskiss and Lord
C---.&nbsp; All objections to his lordship&rsquo;s unwilling
attentions were suddenly withdrawn by the lady.&nbsp; Indeed, so
swift to come and go are the whims of women, his calls were
actually encouraged, especially when, as generally happened, they
coincided with the absence from home of Mr. and Mrs.
Hodskiss.&nbsp; Quite as remarkable was the new-born desire of
Lord C--- towards Miss Clementina Hodskiss.&nbsp; Mary&rsquo;s
name was never mentioned, and the suggestion of immediate
marriage was listened to without remonstrance.&nbsp; Wiser folk
would have puzzled their brains, but both her ladyship and
ex-Contractor Hodskiss were accustomed to find all things yield
to their wishes.&nbsp; The countess saw visions of a
rehabilitated estate, and Clementina&rsquo;s father dreamed of a
peerage, secured by the influence of aristocratic
connections.&nbsp; All that the young folks stipulated for (and
on that point their firmness was supernatural) was that the
marriage should be quiet, almost to the verge of secrecy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No beastly fuss,&rdquo; his lordship demanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let it be somewhere in the country, and no mob!&rdquo; and
his mother, thinking she understood his reason, patted his cheek
affectionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to go down to Aunt Jane&rsquo;s and be
married quietly from there,&rdquo; explained Miss Hodskiss to her
father.</p>
<p>Aunt Jane resided on the outskirts of a small Hampshire
village, and &ldquo;sat under&rdquo; a clergyman famous
throughout the neighbourhood for having lost the roof to his
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be married by that old fool,&rdquo;
thundered her father&mdash;Mr. Hodskiss always thundered; he
thundered even his prayers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He christened me,&rdquo; urged Miss Clementina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Lord knows what he called you.&nbsp; Nobody can
understand a word he says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like him to marry me,&rdquo; reiterated Miss
Clementina.</p>
<p>Neither her ladyship nor the contractor liked the idea.&nbsp;
The latter in particular had looked forward to a big function,
chronicled at length in all the newspapers.&nbsp; But after all,
the marriage was the essential thing, and perhaps, having regard
to some foolish love passages that had happened between
Clementina and a certain penniless naval lieutenant, ostentation
might be out of place.</p>
<p>So in due course Clementina departed for Aunt Jane&rsquo;s,
accompanied only by her maid.</p>
<p>Quite a treasure was Miss Hodskiss&rsquo;s new maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A clean, wholesome girl,&rdquo; said of her Contractor
Hodskiss, who cultivated affability towards the lower orders;
&ldquo;knows her place, and talks sense.&nbsp; You keep that
girl, Clemmy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she knows enough?&rdquo; hazarded the
maternal Hodskiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite sufficient for any decent woman,&rdquo; retorted
the contractor.&nbsp; &ldquo;When Clemmy wants painting and
stuffing, it will be time enough for her to think about getting
one of your &lsquo;<i>Ach Himmels</i>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<i>Mon
Dieus</i>&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the girl myself immensely,&rdquo; agreed
Clementina&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can trust her, and
she doesn&rsquo;t give herself airs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her praises reached even the countess, suffering severely at
the moment from the tyranny of an elderly Fraulein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see this treasure,&rdquo; thought the countess
to herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am tired of these foreign
minxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no matter at what cunning hour her ladyship might call,
the &ldquo;treasure&rdquo; always happened for some reason or
other to be abroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your girl is always out when I come,&rdquo; laughed the
countess.&nbsp; &ldquo;One would fancy there was some reason for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem odd,&rdquo; agreed Clementina, with a
slight flush.</p>
<p>Miss Hodskiss herself showed rather than spoke her
appreciation of the girl.&nbsp; She seemed unable to move or
think without her.&nbsp; Not even from the interviews with Lord
C--- was the maid always absent.</p>
<p>The marriage, it was settled, should be by licence.&nbsp; Mrs.
Hodskiss made up her mind at first to run down and see to the
preliminaries, but really when the time arrived it hardly seemed
necessary to take that trouble.&nbsp; The ordering of the whole
affair was so very simple, and the &ldquo;treasure&rdquo;
appeared to understand the business most thoroughly, and to be
willing to take the whole burden upon her own shoulders.&nbsp; It
was not, therefore, until the evening before the wedding that the
Hodskiss family arrived in force, filling Aunt Jane&rsquo;s small
dwelling to its utmost capacity.&nbsp; The swelling figure of the
contractor, standing beside the tiny porch, compelled the
passer-by to think of the doll&rsquo;s house in which the dwarf
resides during fair-time, ringing his own bell out of his own
first-floor window.&nbsp; The countess and Lord C--- were staying
with her ladyship&rsquo;s sister, the Hon. Mrs. J---, at G---
Hall, some ten miles distant, and were to drive over in the
morning.&nbsp; The then Earl of --- was in Norway, salmon
fishing.&nbsp; Domestic events did not interest him.</p>
<p>Clementina complained of a headache after dinner, and went to
bed early.&nbsp; The &ldquo;treasure&rdquo; also was
indisposed.&nbsp; She seemed worried and excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That girl is as eager about the thing,&rdquo; remarked
Mrs. Hodskiss, &ldquo;as though it was her own
marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the morning Clementina was still suffering from her
headache, but asserted her ability to go through the ceremony,
provided everybody would keep away, and not worry her.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;treasure&rdquo; was the only person she felt she could
bear to have about her.&nbsp; Half an hour before it was time to
start for church her mother looked her up again.&nbsp; She had
grown still paler, if possible, during the interval, and also
more nervous and irritable.&nbsp; She threatened to go to bed and
stop there if she was not left quite alone.&nbsp; She almost
turned her mother out of the room, locking the door behind
her.&nbsp; Mrs. Hodskiss had never known her daughter to be like
this before.</p>
<p>The others went on, leaving her to follow in the last carriage
with her father.&nbsp; The contractor, forewarned, spoke little
to her.&nbsp; Only once he had occasion to ask her a question,
and then she answered in a strained, unnatural voice.&nbsp; She
appeared, so far as could be seen under her heavy veil, to be
crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is going to be a damned cheerful
wedding,&rdquo; said Mr. Hodskiss, and lapsed into sulkiness.</p>
<p>The wedding was not so quiet as had been anticipated.&nbsp;
The village had got scent of it, and had spread itself upon the
event, while half the house party from G--- Hall had insisted on
driving over to take part in the proceedings.&nbsp; The little
church was better filled than it had been for many a long year
past.</p>
<p>The presence of the stylish crowd unnerved the ancient
clergyman, long unaccustomed to the sight of a strange face, and
the first sound of the ancient clergyman&rsquo;s voice unnerved
the stylish crowd.&nbsp; What little articulation he possessed
entirely disappeared, no one could understand a word he
said.&nbsp; He appeared to be uttering sounds of distress.&nbsp;
The ancient gentleman&rsquo;s infliction had to be explained in
low asides, and it also had to be explained why such an one had
been chosen to perform the ceremony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a whim of Clementina&rsquo;s,&rdquo; whispered
her mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her father and myself were married from
here, and he christened her.&nbsp; The dear child&rsquo;s full of
sentiment.&nbsp; I think it so nice of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody agreed it was charming, but wished it were
over.&nbsp; The general effect was weird in the extreme.</p>
<p>Lord C--- spoke up fairly well, but the bride&rsquo;s
responses were singularly indistinct, the usual order of things
being thus reversed.&nbsp; The story of the naval lieutenant was
remembered, and added to, and some of the more sentimental of the
women began to cry in sympathy.</p>
<p>In the vestry things assumed a brighter tone.&nbsp; There was
no lack of witnesses to sign the register.&nbsp; The verger
pointed out to them the place, and they wrote their names, as
people in such cases do, without stopping to read.&nbsp; Then it
occurred to some one that the bride had not yet signed.&nbsp; She
stood apart, with her veil still down, and appeared to have been
forgotten.&nbsp; Encouraged, she came forward meekly, and took
the pen from the hand of the verger.&nbsp; The countess came and
stood behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; wrote the bride, in a hand that looked as
though it ought to have been firm, but which was not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said the countess, &ldquo;I never knew
there was a Mary in your name.&nbsp; How differently you write
when you write slowly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bride did not answer, but followed with
&ldquo;Susannah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what a lot of names you must have, my dear!&rdquo;
exclaimed the countess.&nbsp; &ldquo;When are you going to get to
the ones we all know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth,&rdquo; continued the bride without answering.</p>
<p>Breeding is not always proof against strong emotion.&nbsp; The
countess snatched the bride&rsquo;s veil from her face, and Mary
Susannah Ruth Sewell stood before her, flushed and trembling, but
looking none the less pretty because of that.&nbsp; At this point
the crowd came in useful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure your ladyship does not wish a scene,&rdquo;
said Mary, speaking low.&nbsp; &ldquo;The thing is
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing can be undone, and will be,&rdquo; retorted
the countess in the same tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;You,
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife, don&rsquo;t forget that, mother,&rdquo; said
Lord C--- coming between them, and slipping Mary&rsquo;s hand on
to his arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are both sorry to have had to go
about the thing in this roundabout way, but we wanted to avoid a
fuss.&nbsp; I think we had better be getting away.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m afraid Mr. Hodskiss is going to be noisy.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The doctor poured himself out a glass of claret, and drank it
off.&nbsp; His throat must have been dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what became of Clementina?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did the naval lieutenant, while the others were at church,
dash up in a post-chaise and carry her off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what ought to have happened, for the whole
thing to be in keeping,&rdquo; agreed the doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
believe as a matter of fact she did marry him eventually, but not
till some years later, after the contractor had died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did Mr. Hodskiss make a noise in the vestry?&rdquo;
I persisted.&nbsp; The doctor never will finish a story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say for certain,&rdquo; answered my host,
&ldquo;I only saw the gentleman once.&nbsp; That was at a
shareholders&rsquo; meeting.&nbsp; I should incline to the
opinion that he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the bride and bridegroom slipped out as
quietly as possible and drove straight off,&rdquo; I
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would have been the sensible thing for them to
do,&rdquo; agreed the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did she manage about her travelling
frock?&rdquo; I continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;She could hardly have
gone back to her Aunt Jane&rsquo;s and changed her
things.&rdquo;&nbsp; The doctor has no mind for
minuti&aelig;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you about all that,&rdquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I mentioned that Mary was a
practical girl.&nbsp; Possibly she had thought of these
details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did the countess take the matter quietly?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>I like a tidy story, where everybody is put into his or her
proper place at the end.&nbsp; Your modern romance leaves half
his characters lying about just anyhow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That also I cannot tell you for certain,&rdquo;
answered the doctor, &ldquo;but I give her credit for so much
sense.&nbsp; Lord C--- was of age, and with Mary at his elbow,
quite knew his own mind.&nbsp; I believe they travelled for two
or three years.&nbsp; The first time I myself set eyes on the
countess (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Mary Sewell) was just after the late
earl&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; I thought she looked a countess, every
inch of her, but then I had not heard the story.&nbsp; I mistook
the dowager for the housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>BLAS&Eacute; BILLY</h2>
<p>It was towards the end of August.&nbsp; He and I appeared to
be the only two men left to the Club.&nbsp; He was sitting by an
open window, the <i>Times</i> lying on the floor beside
him.&nbsp; I drew my chair a little closer and
remarked:&mdash;&ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suppressed a yawn, and replied
&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;dropping the
&ldquo;g.&rdquo;&nbsp; The custom was just coming into fashion;
he was always correct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to be a very hot day, I am afraid,&rdquo; I
continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Fraid so,&rdquo; was the response, after which
he turned his head away and gently closed his eyes.</p>
<p>I opined that conversation was not to his wish, but this only
made me more determined to talk, and to talk to him above all
others in London.&nbsp; The desire took hold of me to irritate
him&mdash;to break down the imperturbable calm within which he
moved and had his being; and I gathered myself together, and
settled down to the task.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting paper the <i>Times</i>,&rdquo; I
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; he replied, taking it from the floor and
handing it to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you read
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had been careful to throw into my voice an aggressive
cheeriness which I had calculated would vex him, but his manner
remained that of a man who is simply bored.&nbsp; I argued with
him politely concerning the paper; but he insisted, still with
the same weary air, that he had done with it.&nbsp; I thanked him
effusively.&nbsp; I judged that he hated effusiveness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say that to read a <i>Times</i> leader,&rdquo; I
persisted, &ldquo;is a lesson in English composition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve been told,&rdquo; he answered
tranquilly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Personally I don&rsquo;t take
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Times</i>, I could see, was not going to be of much
assistance to me.&nbsp; I lit a cigarette, and remarked that he
was not shooting.&nbsp; He admitted the fact.&nbsp; Under the
circumstances, it would have taxed him to deny it, but the
necessity for confession aroused him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a tramp through miles
of mud, in company with four gloomy men in black velveteen, a
couple of depressed-looking dogs, and a heavy gun, the entire
cavalcade being organised for the purpose of killing some
twelve-and-sixpence worth of poultry, suggests the
disproportionate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed boisterously, and cried, &ldquo;Good,
good&mdash;very good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was the type of man that shudders inwardly at the sound of
laughter.&nbsp; I had the will to slap him on the back, but I
thought maybe that would send him away altogether.</p>
<p>I asked him if he hunted.&nbsp; He replied that fourteen
hours&rsquo; talk a day about horses, and only about horses tired
him, and that in consequence he had abandoned hunting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fish?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was never sufficiently imaginative,&rdquo; he
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You travel a good deal,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>He had apparently made up his mind to abandon himself to his
fate, for he turned towards me with a resigned air.&nbsp; An
ancient nurse of mine had always described me as the most
&ldquo;wearing&rdquo; child she had ever come across.&nbsp; I
prefer to speak of myself as persevering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should go about more,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;were I
able to see any difference between one place and
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tried Central Africa?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once or twice,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
always reminds me of Kew Gardens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;China?&rdquo; I hazarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cross between a willow-pattern plate and a New York
slum,&rdquo; was his comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The North Pole?&rdquo; I tried, thinking the third time
might be lucky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never got quite up to it,&rdquo; he returned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Reached Cape Hakluyt once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did that impress you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t impress me,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>The talk drifted to women and bogus companies, dogs,
literature, and such-like matters.&nbsp; I found him well
informed upon and bored by all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They used to be amusing,&rdquo; he said, speaking of
the first named, &ldquo;until they began to take themselves
seriously.&nbsp; Now they are merely silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was forced into closer companionship with
&ldquo;Blas&eacute; Billy&rdquo; that autumn, for by chance a
month later he and I found ourselves the guests of the same
delightful hostess, and I came to liking him better.&nbsp; He was
a useful man to have about one.&nbsp; In matters of fashion one
could always feel safe following his lead.&nbsp; One knew that
his necktie, his collar, his socks, if not the very newest
departure, were always correct; and upon social paths, as guide,
philosopher, and friend, he was invaluable.&nbsp; He knew every
one, together with his or her previous convictions.&nbsp; He was
acquainted with every woman&rsquo;s past, and shrewdly surmised
every man&rsquo;s future.&nbsp; He could point you out the
coal-shed where the Countess of Glenleman had gambolled in her
days of innocence, and would take you to breakfast at the
coffee-shop off the Mile End Road where &ldquo;Sam. Smith, Estd.
1820,&rdquo; own brother to the world-famed society novelist,
Smith-Stratford, lived an uncriticised, unparagraphed,
unphotographed existence upon the profits of
&ldquo;rashers&rdquo; at three-ha&rsquo;pence and
&ldquo;door-steps&rdquo; at two a penny.&nbsp; He knew at what
houses it was inadvisable to introduce soap, and at what tables
it would be bad form to denounce political jobbery.&nbsp; He
could tell you offhand what trade-mark went with what crest, and
remembered the price paid for every baronetcy created during the
last twenty-five years.</p>
<p>Regarding himself, he might have made claim with King Charles
never to have said a foolish thing, and never to have done a wise
one.&nbsp; He despised, or affected to despise, most of his
fellow-men, and those of his fellow-men whose opinion was most
worth having unaffectedly despised him.</p>
<p>Shortly described, one might have likened him to a Gaiety
Johnny with brains.&nbsp; He was capital company after dinner,
but in the early morning one avoided him.</p>
<p>So I thought of him until one day he fell in love; or to put
it in the words of Teddy Tidmarsh, who brought the news to us,
&ldquo;got mashed on Gerty Lovell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The red-haired one,&rdquo; Teddy explained, to
distinguish her from her sister, who had lately adopted the newer
golden shade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gerty Lovell!&rdquo; exclaimed the captain, &ldquo;why,
I&rsquo;ve always been told the Lovell girls hadn&rsquo;t a penny
among them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man&rsquo;s stone broke, I know for a
certainty,&rdquo; volunteered Teddy, who picked up a mysterious
but, in other respects, satisfactory income in an office near
Hatton Garden, and who was candour itself concerning the private
affairs of everybody but himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, some rich pork-packing or diamond-sweating uncle
has cropped up in Australia, or America, or one of those
places,&rdquo; suggested the captain, &ldquo;and Billy&rsquo;s
got wind of it in good time.&nbsp; Billy knows his way
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We agreed that some such explanation was needed, though in all
other respects Gerty Lovell was just the girl that Reason (not
always consulted on these occasions) might herself have chosen
for &ldquo;Blas&eacute; Billy&rsquo;s&rdquo; mate.</p>
<p>The sunlight was not too kind to her, but at evening parties,
where the lighting has been well considered, I have seen her look
quite girlish.&nbsp; At her best she was not beautiful, but at
her worst there was about her an air of breeding and distinction
that always saved her from being passed over, and she dressed to
perfection.&nbsp; In character she was the typical society woman:
always charming, generally insincere.&nbsp; She went to
Kensington for her religion and to Mayfair for her morals;
accepted her literature from Mudie&rsquo;s and her art from the
Grosvenor Gallery; and could and would gabble philanthropy,
philosophy, and politics with equal fluency at every
five-o&rsquo;clock tea-table she visited.&nbsp; Her ideas could
always be guaranteed as the very latest, and her opinion as that
of the person to whom she was talking.&nbsp; Asked by a famous
novelist one afternoon, at the Pioneer Club, to give him some
idea of her, little Mrs. Bund, the painter&rsquo;s wife, had
remained for a few moments with her pretty lips pursed, and had
then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a woman to whom life could bring nothing more
fully satisfying than a dinner invitation from a duchess, and
whose nature would be incapable of sustaining deeper suffering
than that caused by an ill-fitting costume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time I should have said the epigram was as true as it
was cruel, but I suppose we none of us quite know each other.</p>
<p>I congratulated &ldquo;Blas&eacute; Billy,&rdquo; or to drop
his Club nickname and give him the full benefit of his social
label, &ldquo;The Hon. William Cecil Wychwood Stanley
Drayton,&rdquo; on the occasion of our next meeting, which
happened upon the steps of the Savoy Restaurant, and I
thought&mdash;unless a quiver of the electric light deceived
me&mdash;that he blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charming girl,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
a lucky dog, Billy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the phrase that custom demands upon such occasions, and
it came of its own accord to my tongue without costing me the
trouble of composition, but he seized upon it as though it had
been a gem of friendly sincerity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will like her even more when you know her
better,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is so different from the
usual woman that one meets.&nbsp; Come and see her to-morrow
afternoon, she will be so pleased.&nbsp; Go about four, I will
tell her to expect you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I rang the bell at ten minutes past five.&nbsp; Billy was
there.&nbsp; She greeted me with a little tremor of
embarrassment, which sat oddly upon her, but which was not
altogether unpleasing.&nbsp; She said it was kind of me to come
so early.&nbsp; I stayed for about half an hour, but conversation
flagged, and some of my cleverest remarks attracted no attention
whatever.</p>
<p>When I rose to take my leave, Billy said that he must be off
too, and that he would accompany me.&nbsp; Had they been ordinary
lovers, I should have been careful to give them an opportunity of
making their adieus in secret; but in the case of the Honourable
William Drayton and the eldest Miss Lovell I concluded that such
tactics were needless, so I waited till he had shaken hands, and
went downstairs with him.</p>
<p>But in the hall Billy suddenly ejaculated, &ldquo;By
Jove!&nbsp; Half a minute,&rdquo; and ran back up the stairs
three at a time.&nbsp; Apparently he found what he had gone for
on the landing, for I did not hear the opening of the
drawing-room door.&nbsp; Then the Honourable Billy redescended
with a sober, nonchalent air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Left my gloves behind me,&rdquo; he explained, as he
took my arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am always leaving my gloves
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not mention that I had seen him take them from his hat
and slip them into his coat-tail pocket.</p>
<p>We at the Club did not see very much of Billy during the next
three months, but the captain, who prided himself upon his
playing of the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of smoking-room
cynic&mdash;though he would have been better in the part had he
occasionally displayed a little originality&mdash;was of opinion
that our loss would be more than made up to us after the
marriage.&nbsp; Once in the twilight I caught sight of a figure
that reminded me of Billy&rsquo;s, accompanied by a figure that
might have been that of the eldest Miss Lovell; but as the spot
was Battersea Park, which is not a fashionable evening promenade,
and the two figures were holding each other&rsquo;s hands, the
whole picture being suggestive of the closing chapter of a
<i>London Journal</i> romance, I concluded I had made an
error.</p>
<p>But I did see them in the Adelphi stalls one evening, rapt in
a sentimental melodrama.&nbsp; I joined them between the acts,
and poked fun at the play, as one does at the Adelphi, but Miss
Lovell begged me quite earnestly not to spoil her interest, and
Billy wanted to enter upon a serious argument as to whether a man
was justified in behaving as Will Terriss had just behaved
towards the woman he loved.&nbsp; I left them and returned to my
own party, to the satisfaction, I am inclined to think, of all
concerned.</p>
<p>They married in due course.&nbsp; We were mistaken on one
point.&nbsp; She brought Billy nothing.&nbsp; But they both
seemed quite content on his not too extravagant fortune.&nbsp;
They took a tiny house not far from Victoria Station, and hired a
brougham for the season.&nbsp; They did not entertain very much,
but they contrived to be seen everywhere it was right and
fashionable they should be seen.&nbsp; The Honourable Mrs.
Drayton was a much younger and brighter person than had been the
eldest Miss Lovell, and as she continued to dress charmingly, her
social position rose rapidly.&nbsp; Billy went everywhere with
her, and evidently took a keen pride in her success.&nbsp; It was
even said that he designed her dresses for her, and I have myself
seen him earnestly studying the costumes in Russell and
Allen&rsquo;s windows.</p>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s prophecy remained unfulfilled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Blas&eacute; Billy&rdquo;&mdash;if the name could still be
applied to him&mdash;hardly ever visited the Club after his
marriage.&nbsp; But I had grown to like him, and, as he had
foretold, to like his wife.&nbsp; I found their calm indifference
to the burning questions of the day a positive relief from the
strenuous atmosphere of literary and artistic circles.&nbsp; In
the drawing-room of their little house in Eaton Row, the
comparative merits of George Meredith and George R. Sims were not
considered worth discussion.&nbsp; Both were regarded as persons
who afforded a certain amount of amusement in return for a
certain amount of cash.&nbsp; And on any Wednesday afternoon,
Henrick Ibsen and Arthur Roberts would have been equally welcome,
as adding piquancy to the small gathering.&nbsp; Had I been
compelled to pass my life in such a house, this Philistine
attitude might have palled upon me; but, under the circumstances,
it refreshed me, and I made use of my welcome, which I believe
was genuine, to its full extent.</p>
<p>As months went by, they seemed to me to draw closer to one
another, though I am given to understand that such is not the
rule in fashionable circles.&nbsp; One evening I arrived a little
before my time, and was shown up into the drawing-room by the
soft-footed butler.&nbsp; They were sitting in the dusk with
their arms round one another.&nbsp; It was impossible to
withdraw, so I faced the situation and coughed.&nbsp; A pair of
middle-class lovers could not have appeared more awkward or
surprised.</p>
<p>But the incident established an understanding between us, and
I came to be regarded as a friend before whom there was less
necessity to act.</p>
<p>Studying them, I came to the conclusion that the ways and
manners of love are very same-like throughout the world, as
though the foolish boy, unheedful of human advance, kept but one
school for minor poet and East End shop-boy, for Girton girl and
little milliner; taught but the one lesson to the
end-of-the-nineteenth-century Johnny that he taught to bearded
Pict and Hun four thousand years ago.</p>
<p>Thus the summer and the winter passed pleasantly for the
Honourable Billy, and then, as luck would have it, he fell ill
just in the very middle of the London season, when invitations to
balls and dinner parties, luncheons and &ldquo;At Homes,&rdquo;
were pouring in from every quarter; when the lawns at Hurlingham
were at their smoothest, and the paddocks at their smartest.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate, too, that the fashions that season suited
the Honourable Mrs. Billy as they had not suited her for
years.&nbsp; In the early spring, she and Billy had been hard at
work planning costumes calculated to cause a flutter through
Mayfair, and the dresses and the bonnets&mdash;each one a work of
art&mdash;were waiting on their stands to do their killing
work.&nbsp; But the Honourable Mrs. Billy, for the first time in
her life, had lost interest in such things.</p>
<p>Their friends were genuinely sorry, for society was
Billy&rsquo;s element, and in it he was interesting and
amusing.&nbsp; But, as Lady Gower said, there was no earthly need
for his wife to constitute herself a prisoner.&nbsp; Her shutting
herself off from the world could do him no good and it would look
odd.</p>
<p>Accordingly the Honourable Mrs. Drayton, to whom oddness was a
crime, and the voice of Lady Gower as the voice of duty,
sacrificed her inclinations on the social shrine, laced the new
costumes tight across her aching heart, and went down into
society.</p>
<p>But the Honourable Mrs. Drayton achieved not the success of
former seasons.&nbsp; Her small talk grew so very small, that
even Park Lane found it unsatisfying.&nbsp; Her famous laugh rang
mechanically.&nbsp; She smiled at the wisdom of dukes, and became
sad at the funny stories of millionaires.&nbsp; Society voted her
a good wife but bad company, and confined its attentions to cards
of inquiry.&nbsp; And for this relief the Honourable Mrs. Drayton
was grateful, for Billy waned weaker and weaker.&nbsp; In the
world of shadows in which she moved, he was the one real
thing.&nbsp; She was of very little practical use, but it
comforted her to think that she was helping to nurse him.</p>
<p>But Billy himself it troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do wish you would go out more,&rdquo; he would
say.&nbsp; &ldquo;It makes me feel that I&rsquo;m such a selfish
brute, keeping you tied up here in this dismal little
house.&nbsp; Besides,&rdquo; he would add, &ldquo;people miss
you; they will hate me for keeping you away.&rdquo;&nbsp; For,
where his wife was concerned, Billy&rsquo;s knowledge of the
world availed him little.&nbsp; He really thought society craved
for the Honourable Mrs. Drayton, and would not be comforted where
she was not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather stop with you, dear,&rdquo; would be the
answer; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to go about by myself.&nbsp;
You must get well quickly and take me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the argument continued, until one evening, as she sat
by herself, the nurse entered softly, closed the door behind her,
and came over to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would go out to-night, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
said the nurse, &ldquo;just for an hour or two.&nbsp; I think it
would please the master; he is worrying himself because he thinks
it is his fault that you do not; and just now&rdquo;&mdash;the
woman hesitated for a moment&mdash;&ldquo;just now I want to keep
him very quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he weaker, nurse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he is not stronger, ma&rsquo;am, and I
think&mdash;I think we must humour him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Honourable Mrs. Drayton rose, and, crossing to the window,
stood for a while looking out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where am I to go, nurse?&rdquo; she said at length,
turning with a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no invitations
anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you make believe to have one?&rdquo; said
the nurse.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is only seven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Say
you are going to a dinner-party; you can come home early
then.&nbsp; Go and dress yourself, and come down and say good-bye
to him, and then come in again about eleven, as though you had
just returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think I must, nurse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be better, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I wish
you would try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Honourable Mrs. Drayton went to the door, then paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has such sharp ears, nurse; he will listen for the
opening of the door and the sound of the carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see to that,&rdquo; said the nurse.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will tell them to have the carriage here at ten minutes
to eight.&nbsp; Then you can drive to the end of the street, slip
out, and walk back.&nbsp; I will let you in myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And about coming home?&rdquo; asked the other
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must slip out for a few minutes before eleven, and
the carriage must be waiting for you at the corner again.&nbsp;
Leave all that to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In half an hour the Honourable Mrs. Drayton entered the
sick-room, radiant in evening dress and jewels.&nbsp; Fortunately
the lights were low, or &ldquo;Blas&eacute;-Billy&rdquo; might
have been doubtful as to the effect his wife was likely to
produce.&nbsp; For her face was not the face that one takes to
dinner-parties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nurse tells me you are going to the Grevilles this
evening.&nbsp; I am so glad.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been worrying
myself about you, moped up here right through the
season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her hands in his and held her out at arm&rsquo;s
length from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How handsome you look, dear!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How they must have all been cursing me for keeping you
shut up here, like a princess in an ogre&rsquo;s castle!&nbsp; I
shall never dare to face them again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, well pleased at his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not be late,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
shall be so anxious to get back and see how my boy has
behaved.&nbsp; If you have not been good I shan&rsquo;t go
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They kissed and parted, and at eleven she returned to the
room.&nbsp; She told him what a delightful evening it had been,
and bragged a little of her own success.</p>
<p>The nurse told her that he had been more cheerful that evening
than for many nights.</p>
<p>So every day the farce was played for him.&nbsp; One day it
was to a luncheon that she went, in a costume by Redfern; the
next night to a ball, in a frock direct from Paris; again to an
&ldquo;At Home,&rdquo; or concert, or dinner-party.&nbsp; Loafers
and passers-by would stop to stare at a haggard, red-eyed woman,
dressed as for a drawing-room, slipping thief-like in and out of
her own door.</p>
<p>I heard them talking of her one afternoon, at a house where I
called, and I joined the group to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always thought her heartless, but I gave her credit
for sense,&rdquo; a woman was saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;One
doesn&rsquo;t expect a woman to be fond of her husband, but she
needn&rsquo;t make a parade of ignoring him when he is
dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pleaded absence from town to inquire what was meant, and
from all lips I heard the same account.&nbsp; One had noticed her
carriage at the door two or three evenings in succession.&nbsp;
Another had seen her returning home.&nbsp; A third had seen her
coming out, and so on.</p>
<p>I could not fit the fact in with my knowledge of her, so the
next evening I called.&nbsp; The door was opened instantly by
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you from the window,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come in here; don&rsquo;t speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I followed her, and she closed the door behind her.&nbsp; She
was dressed in a magnificent costume, her hair sparkling with
diamonds, and I looked my questions.</p>
<p>She laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am supposed to be at the opera to-night,&rdquo; she
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sit down, if you have a few minutes to
spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said it was for a talk that I had come; and there, in the
dark room, lighted only by the street lamp without, she told me
all.&nbsp; And at the end she dropped her head on her bare arms;
and I turned away and looked out of the window for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel so ridiculous,&rdquo; she said, rising and
coming towards me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I sit here all the evening
dressed like this.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t act my
part very well; but, fortunately, dear Billy never was much of a
judge of art, and it is good enough for him.&nbsp; I tell him the
most awful lies about what everybody has said to me, and what
I&rsquo;ve said to everybody, and how my gowns were
admired.&nbsp; What do you think of this one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer I took the privilege of a friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think well of me,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Billy has such a high opinion of you.&nbsp;
You will hear some funny tales.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had to leave London again, and Billy died before I
returned.&nbsp; I heard that she had to be fetched from a ball,
and was only just in time to touch his lips before they were
cold.&nbsp; But her friends excused her by saying that the end
had come very suddenly.</p>
<p>I called on her a little later, and before I left I hinted to
her what people were saying, and asked her if I had not better
tell them the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems like making public the secret
side of one&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I urged, &ldquo;they will
think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She interrupted me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it matter very much what they think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which struck me as a very remarkable sentiment, coming from
the Hon. Mrs. Drayton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> the elder Miss
Lovell.</p>
<h2>THE CHOICE OF CYRIL HARJOHN</h2>
<p>Between a junior resident master of twenty-one, and a backward
lad of fifteen, there yawns an impassable gulf.&nbsp; Between a
struggling journalist of one-and-thirty, and an M.D. of
twenty-five, with a brilliant record behind him, and a career of
exceptional promise before him, a close friendship is however
permissible.</p>
<p>My introduction to Cyril Harjohn was through the Rev. Charles
Fauerberg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our young friend,&rdquo; said the Rev. Mr. Fauerberg,
standing in the most approved tutorial attitude, with his hand
upon his pupil&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;our young friend has been
somewhat neglected, but I see in him possibilities warranting
hope&mdash;warranting, I may say, very great hope.&nbsp; For the
present he will be under my especial care, and you will not
therefore concern yourself with his studies.&nbsp; He will sleep
with Milling and the others in dormitory number two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad formed a liking for me, and I think, and hope, I
rendered his sojourn at &ldquo;Alpha House&rdquo; less irksome
than otherwise it might have been.&nbsp; The Reverend
Charles&rsquo; method with the backward was on all fours with
that adopted for the bringing on of geese; he cooped them up and
crammed them.&nbsp; The process is profitable to the trainer, but
painful to the goose.</p>
<p>Young Harjohn and myself left &ldquo;Alpha House&rdquo; at the
end of the same term; he bound for Brasenose, I for
Bloomsbury.&nbsp; He made a point of never coming up to London
without calling on me, when we would dine together in one of
Soho&rsquo;s many dingy, garlic-scented restaurants, and
afterwards, over our bottle of cheap Beaune, discuss the coming
of our lives; and when he entered Guy&rsquo;s I left John Street,
and took chambers close to his in Staple Inn.&nbsp; Those were
pleasant days.&nbsp; Childhood is an over-rated period, fuller of
sorrow than of joy.&nbsp; I would not take my childhood back,
were it a gift, but I would give the rest of my life to live the
twenties over again.</p>
<p>To Cyril I was the man of the world, and he looked to me for
wisdom, not seeing always, I fear, that he got it; while from him
I gathered enthusiasm, and learnt the profit that comes to a man
from the keeping of ideals.</p>
<p>Often as we have talked, I have felt as though a visible light
came from him, framing his face as with the halo of some pictured
saint.&nbsp; Nature had wasted him, putting him into this
nineteenth century of ours.&nbsp; Her victories are
accomplished.&nbsp; Her army of heroes, the few sung, the many
forgotten, is disbanded.&nbsp; The long peace won by their blood
and pain is settled on the land.&nbsp; She had fashioned Cyril
Harjohn for one of her soldiers.&nbsp; He would have been a
martyr, in the days when thought led to the stake, a fighter for
the truth, when to speak one&rsquo;s mind meant death.&nbsp; To
lead some forlorn hope for Civilisation would have been his true
work; Fate had condemned him to sentry duty in a well-ordered
barrack.</p>
<p>But there is work to be done in the world, though the labour
lies now in the vineyard, not on the battlefield.&nbsp; A small
but sufficient fortune purchased for him freedom.&nbsp; To most
men an assured income is the grave of ambition; to Cyril it was
the foundation of desire.&nbsp; Relieved from the necessity of
working to live, he could afford the luxury of living to
work.&nbsp; His profession was to him a passion; he regarded it,
not with the cold curiosity of the scholar, but with the
imaginative devotion of the disciple.&nbsp; To help to push its
frontiers forward, to carry its flag farther into the untravelled
desert that ever lies beyond the moving boundary of human
knowledge, was his dream.</p>
<p>One summer evening, I remember, we were sitting in his rooms,
and during a silence there came to us through the open window the
moaning of the city, as of a tired child.&nbsp; He rose and
stretched his arms out towards the darkening streets, as if he
would gather to him all the toiling men and women and comfort
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that I could help you!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;my
brothers and my sisters.&nbsp; Take my life, oh God, and spend it
for me among your people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speech sounds theatrical, as I read it, written down, but
to the young such words are not ridiculous, as to us older
men.</p>
<p>In the natural order of events, he fell in love, and with just
the woman one would expect him to be attracted by.&nbsp; Elspeth
Grant was of the type from which the world, by instinct rather
than by convention, has drawn its Madonnas and its saints.&nbsp;
To describe a woman in words is impossible.&nbsp; Her beauty was
not a possession to be catalogued, but herself.&nbsp; One felt it
as one feels the beauty of a summer&rsquo;s dawn breaking the
shadows of a sleeping city, but one cannot set it down.&nbsp; I
often met her, and, when talking to her, I knew myself&mdash;I,
hack-journalist, frequenter of Fleet Street bars, retailer of
smoke-room stories&mdash;a great gentleman, incapable of
meanness, fit for all noble deeds.</p>
<p>In her presence life became a thing beautiful and gracious; a
school for courtesy, and tenderness, and simplicity.</p>
<p>I have wondered since, coming to see a little more clearly
into the ways of men, whether it would not have been better had
she been less spiritual, had her nature possessed a greater alloy
of earth, making it more fit for the uses of this work-a-day
world.&nbsp; But at the time, these two friends of mine seemed to
me to have been created for one another.</p>
<p>She appealed to all that was highest in Cyril&rsquo;s
character, and he worshipped her with an unconcealed adoration
that, from any man less high-minded, would have appeared
affectation, and which she accepted with the sweet content that
Artemis might have accorded to the homage of Endymion.</p>
<p>There was no formal engagement between them.&nbsp; Cyril
seemed to shrink from the materialising of his love by any
thought of marriage.&nbsp; To him she was an ideal of womanhood
rather than a flesh-and-blood woman.&nbsp; His love for her was a
religion; it had no taint of earthly passion in its
composition.</p>
<p>Had I known the world better I might have anticipated the
result; for the red blood ran in my friend&rsquo;s veins; and,
alas, we dream our poems, not live them.&nbsp; But at the time,
the idea of any other woman coming between them would have
appeared to me folly.&nbsp; The suggestion that that other woman
might be Geraldine Fawley I should have resented as an insult to
my intelligence: that is the point of the story I do not
understand to this day.</p>
<p>That he should be attracted by her, that he should love to
linger near her, watching the dark flush come and go across her
face, seeking to call the fire into her dark eyes was another
matter, and quite comprehensible; for the girl was wonderfully
handsome, with a bold, voluptuous beauty which invited while it
dared.&nbsp; But considered in any other light than that of an
animal, she repelled.&nbsp; At times when, for her ends, it
seemed worth the exertion, she would assume a certain wayward
sweetness, but her acting was always clumsy and exaggerated,
capable of deceiving no one but a fool.</p>
<p>Cyril, at all events, was not taken in by it.&nbsp; One
evening, at a Bohemian gathering, the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> to
which was notoriety rather than character, they had been talking
together for some considerable time when, wishing to speak to
Cyril, I strolled up to join them.&nbsp; As I came towards them
she moved away, her dislike for me being equal to mine for her; a
thing which was, perhaps, well for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Fawley prefers two as company to three,&rdquo; I
observed, looking after her retreating figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid she finds you what we should call an
anti-sympathetic element,&rdquo; he replied, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like her?&rdquo; I asked him, somewhat
bluntly.</p>
<p>His eyes rested upon her as she stood in the doorway, talking
to a small, black-bearded man who had just been introduced to
her.&nbsp; After a few moments she went out upon his arm, and
then Cyril turned to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think her,&rdquo; he replied, speaking, as was
necessary, very low, &ldquo;the embodiment of all that is evil in
womanhood.&nbsp; In old days she would have been a Cleopatra, a
Theodora, a Delilah.&nbsp; To-day, lacking opportunity, she is
the &lsquo;smart woman&rsquo; grubbing for an opening into
society&mdash;and old Fawley&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
tired; let us go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His allusion to her parentage was significant.&nbsp; Few
people thought of connecting clever, handsome Geraldine Fawley
with &ldquo;Rogue Fawley,&rdquo; Jew renegade, ex-gaol bird, and
outside broker; who, having expectations from his daughter, took
care not to hamper her by ever being seen in her company.&nbsp;
But no one who had once met the father could ever forget the
relationship while talking to the daughter.&nbsp; The older face,
with its cruelty, its cunning, and its greed stood reproduced,
feature for feature, line for line.&nbsp; It was as though
Nature, for an artistic freak, had set herself the task of
fashioning hideousness and beauty from precisely the same
materials.&nbsp; Between the leer of the man and the smile of the
girl, where lay the difference?&nbsp; It would have puzzled any
student of anatomy to point it out.&nbsp; Yet the one sickened,
while to gain the other most men would have given much.</p>
<p>Cyril&rsquo;s answer to my question satisfied me for the
time.&nbsp; He met the girl often, as was natural.&nbsp; She was
a singer of some repute, and our social circle was what is
commonly called &ldquo;literary and artistic.&rdquo;&nbsp; To do
her justice, however, she made no attempt to fascinate him, nor
even to be particularly agreeable to him.&nbsp; Indeed, she
seemed to be at pains to show him her natural&mdash;in other
words, her most objectionable side.</p>
<p>Coming out of the theatre one first night, we met her in the
lobby.&nbsp; I was following Cyril at some little distance, but
as he stopped to speak to her the movement of the crowd placed me
just behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be at Leightons&rsquo; to-morrow?&rdquo; I
heard him ask her in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and I wish you
wouldn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re a fool, and you bore
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under ordinary circumstances I should have taken the speech
for badinage&mdash;it was the kind of wit the woman would have
indulged in.&nbsp; But Cyril&rsquo;s face clouded with anger and
vexation.&nbsp; I said nothing.&nbsp; I did not wish him to know
that I had overheard.&nbsp; I tried to believe that he was
amusing himself, but my own explanation did not satisfy me.</p>
<p>Next evening I went to Leightons&rsquo; by myself.&nbsp; The
Grants were in town, and Cyril was dining with them.&nbsp; I
found I did not know many people, and cared little for those I
did.&nbsp; I was about to escape when Miss Fawley&rsquo;s name
was announced.&nbsp; I was close to the door, and she had to stop
and speak to me.&nbsp; We exchanged a few commonplaces.&nbsp; She
either made love to a man or was rude to him.&nbsp; She generally
talked to me without looking at me, nodding and smiling meanwhile
to people around.&nbsp; I have met many women equally
ill-mannered, and without her excuse.&nbsp; For a moment,
however, she turned her eyes to mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your friend, Mr. Harjohn?&rdquo; she
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought you were inseparables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at her in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is dining out to-night,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I do not think he will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed.&nbsp; I think it was the worst part about the
woman, her laugh; it suggested so much cruelty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he will,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>It angered me into an indiscretion.&nbsp; She was moving
away.&nbsp; I stepped in front of her and stopped her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo; I asked, and my voice,
I know, betrayed the anxiety I felt as to her reply.&nbsp; She
looked me straight in the face.&nbsp; There was one virtue she
possessed&mdash;the virtue that animals hold above
mankind&mdash;truthfulness.&nbsp; She knew I disliked
her&mdash;hate would be, perhaps, a more exact expression, did
not the word sound out of date, and she made no pretence of not
knowing it and returning the compliment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I am here,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you save him?&nbsp; Have you no influence
over him?&nbsp; Tell the Saint to keep him; I don&rsquo;t want
him.&nbsp; You heard what I said to him last night.&nbsp; I shall
only marry him for the sake of his position, and the money he can
earn if he likes to work and not play the fool.&nbsp; Tell him
what I have said; I shan&rsquo;t deny it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She passed on to greet a decrepit old lord with a languishing
smile, and I stood staring after her with, I fear, a somewhat
stupid expression, until some young fool came up grinning, to ask
me whether I had seen a ghost or backed a &ldquo;wrong
&rsquo;un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no need to wait; I felt no curiosity.&nbsp;
Something told me the woman had spoken the truth.&nbsp; It was
mere want of motive that made me linger.&nbsp; I saw him come in,
and watched him hanging round her, like a dog, waiting for a kind
word, or failing that, a look.&nbsp; I knew she saw me, and I
knew it added to her zest that I was there.&nbsp; Not till we
were in the street did I speak to him.&nbsp; He started as I
touched him.&nbsp; We were neither of us good actors.&nbsp; He
must have read much in my face, and I saw that he had read it;
and we walked side by side in silence, I thinking what to say,
wondering whether I should do good or harm, wishing that we were
anywhere but in these silent, life-packed streets, so filled with
the unseen.&nbsp; It was not until we had nearly reached the
Albert Hall that we broke the silence.&nbsp; Then it was he who
spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I haven&rsquo;t told myself all
that?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think I don&rsquo;t
know I&rsquo;m a damned fool, a cad, a liar!&nbsp; What the
devil&rsquo;s the good of talking about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;because you&rsquo;re a
fool, because you have only seen one side of me.&nbsp; You think
me a grand gentleman, because I talk big, and am full of noble
sentiment.&nbsp; Why, you idiot, the Devil himself could take you
in.&nbsp; <i>He</i> has his fine moods, I suppose, talks like a
saint, and says his prayers with the rest of us.&nbsp; Do you
remember the first night at old Fauerberg&rsquo;s?&nbsp; You
poked your silly head into the dormitory, and saw me kneeling by
the bedside, while the other fellows stood by grinning.&nbsp; You
closed the door softly&mdash;you thought I never saw you.&nbsp; I
was not praying, I was trying to pray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It showed that you had pluck, if it showed nothing
else,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Most boys would not have
tried, and you kept it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I promised the
Mater I would, and I did.&nbsp; Poor old soul, she was as big a
fool as you are.&nbsp; She believed in me.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
remember, finding me one Saturday afternoon all alone, stuffing
myself with cake and jam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed at the recollection, though Heaven knows I was in no
laughing mood.&nbsp; I had found him with an array of pastry
spread out before him, sufficient to make him ill for a week, and
I had boxed his ears, and had thrown the whole collection into
the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mater gave me half-a-crown a week for
pocket-money,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and I told the fellows
I had only a shilling, so that I could gorge myself with the
other eighteenpence undisturbed.&nbsp; Pah!&nbsp; I was a little
beast even in those days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was only a schoolboy trick,&rdquo; I argued,
&ldquo;it was natural enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and this is only a
man&rsquo;s trick, and is natural enough; but it is going to ruin
my life, to turn me into a beast instead of a man.&nbsp; Good
God! do you think I don&rsquo;t know what that woman will do for
me?&nbsp; She will drag me down, down, down, to her own
level.&nbsp; All my ideals, all my ambition, all my life&rsquo;s
work will be bartered for a smug practice, among paying
patients.&nbsp; I shall scheme and plot to make a big income that
we may live like a couple of plump animals, that we may dress
ourselves gaudily and parade our wealth.&nbsp; Nothing will
satisfy her.&nbsp; Such women are leeches; their only cry is
&lsquo;give, give, give.&rsquo;&nbsp; So long as I can supply her
with money she will tolerate me, and to get it for her I shall
sell my heart, and my brain, and my soul.&nbsp; She will load
herself with jewels, and go about from house to house, half
naked, to leer at every man she comes across: that is
&lsquo;life&rsquo; to such women.&nbsp; And I shall trot behind
her, the laughing stock of every fool, the contempt of every
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His vehemence made any words I could say sound weak before
they were uttered.&nbsp; What argument could I show stronger than
that he had already put before himself?&nbsp; I knew his answer
to everything I could urge.</p>
<p>My mistake had been in imagining him different from other
men.&nbsp; I began to see that he was like the rest of us: part
angel, part devil.&nbsp; But the new point he revealed to me was
that the higher the one, the lower the other.&nbsp; It seems as
if nature must balance her work; the nearer the leaves to heaven,
the deeper the roots striking down into the darkness.&nbsp; I
knew that his passion for this woman made no change in his truer
love.&nbsp; The one was a spiritual, the other a mere animal
passion.&nbsp; The memory of incidents that had puzzled me came
back to enlighten me.&nbsp; I remembered how often on nights when
I had sat up late, working, I had heard his steps pass my door,
heavy and uncertain; how once in a dingy quarter of London, I had
met one who had strangely resembled him.&nbsp; I had followed him
to speak, but the man&rsquo;s bleared eyes had stared angrily at
me, and I had turned away, calling myself a fool for my
mistake.&nbsp; But as I looked at the face beside me now, I
understood.</p>
<p>And then there rose up before my eyes the face I knew better,
the eager noble face that to merely look upon had been
good.&nbsp; We had reached a small, evil-smelling street, leading
from Leicester Square towards Holborn.&nbsp; I caught him by the
shoulders and turned him round with his back against some church
railings.&nbsp; I forget what I said.&nbsp; We are strange
mixtures.&nbsp; I thought of the shy, backward boy I had coached
and bullied at old Fauerberg&rsquo;s, of the laughing handsome
lad I had watched grow into manhood.&nbsp; The very restaurant we
had most frequented in his old Oxford days&mdash;where we had
poured out our souls to one another, was in this very street
where we were standing.&nbsp; For the moment I felt towards him
as perhaps his mother might have felt; I wanted to scold him and
to cry with him; to shake him and to put my arms about him.&nbsp;
I pleaded with him, and urged him, and called him every name I
could put my tongue to.&nbsp; It must have seemed an odd
conversation.&nbsp; A passing policeman, making a not unnatural
mistake, turned his bull&rsquo;s-eye upon us, and advised us
sternly to go home.&nbsp; We laughed, and with that laugh Cyril
came back to his own self, and we walked on to Staple Inn more
soberly.&nbsp; He promised me to go away by the very first train
the next morning, and to travel for some four or five months, and
I undertook to make all the necessary explanations for him.</p>
<p>We both felt better for our talk, and when I wished him
good-night at his door, it was the real Cyril Harjohn whose hand
I gripped&mdash;the real Cyril, because the best that is in a man
is his real self.&nbsp; If there be any future for man beyond
this world, it is the good that is in him that will live.&nbsp;
The other side of him is of the earth; it is that he will leave
behind him.</p>
<p>He kept his word.&nbsp; In the morning he was gone, and I
never saw him again.&nbsp; I had many letters from him, hopeful
at first, full of strong resolves.&nbsp; He told me he had
written to Elspeth, not telling her everything, for that she
would not understand, but so much as would explain; and from her
he had had sweet womanly letters in reply.&nbsp; I feared she
might have been cold and unsympathetic, for often good women,
untouched by temptation themselves, have small tenderness for
those who struggle.&nbsp; But her goodness was something more
than a mere passive quantity; she loved him the better because he
had need of her.&nbsp; I believe she would have saved him from
himself, had not fate interfered and taken the matter out of her
hands.&nbsp; Women are capable of big sacrifices; I think this
woman would have been content to lower herself, if by so doing
she could have raised him.</p>
<p>But it was not to be.&nbsp; From India he wrote to me that he
was coming home.&nbsp; I had not met the Fawley woman for some
time, and she had gone out of my mind until one day, chancing
upon a theatrical paper, some weeks old, I read that &ldquo;Miss
Fawley had sailed for Calcutta to fulfil an engagement of long
standing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had his last letter in my pocket.&nbsp; I sat down and
worked out the question of date.&nbsp; She would arrive in
Calcutta the day before he left.&nbsp; Whether it was chance or
intention on her part I never knew; as likely as not the former,
for there is a fatalism in this world shaping our ends.</p>
<p>I heard no more from him, I hardly expected to do so, but
three months later a mutual acquaintance stopped me on the Club
steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard the news,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;about
young Harjohn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is he
married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Married,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;No, poor devil,
he&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; was on my lips, but fortunately I
checked myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a shooting party, up at some Rajah&rsquo;s
place.&nbsp; Must have caught his gun in some brambles, I
suppose.&nbsp; The bullet went clean through his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;how very
sad!&rdquo;&nbsp; I could think of nothing else to say at the
moment.</p>
<h2>THE MATERIALISATION OF CHARLES AND MIVANWAY</h2>
<p>The fault that most people will find with this story is that
it is unconvincing.&nbsp; Its scheme is improbable, its
atmosphere artificial.&nbsp; To confess that the thing really
happened&mdash;not as I am about to set it down, for the pen of
the professional writer cannot but adorn and embroider, even to
the detriment of his material&mdash;is, I am well aware, only an
aggravation of my offence, for the facts of life are the
impossibilities of fiction.&nbsp; A truer artist would have left
this story alone, or at most have kept it for the irritation of
his private circle.&nbsp; My lower instinct is to make use of
it.&nbsp; A very old man told me the tale.&nbsp; He was landlord
of the Cromlech Arms, the only inn of a small, rock-sheltered
village on the north-east coast of Cornwall, and had been so for
nine and forty years.&nbsp; It is called the Cromlech Hotel now,
and is under new management, and during the season some four
coach-loads of tourists sit down each day to <i>table
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> lunch in the low-ceilinged parlour.&nbsp;
But I am speaking of years ago, when the place was a mere fishing
harbour, undiscovered by the guide books.</p>
<p>The old landlord talked, and I hearkened the while we both sat
drinking thin ale from earthenware mugs, late one summer&rsquo;s
evening, on the bench that runs along the wall just beneath the
latticed windows.&nbsp; And during the many pauses, when the old
landlord stopped to puff his pipe in silence, and lay in a new
stock of breath, there came to us the murmuring voices of the
Atlantic; and often, mingled with the pompous roar of the big
breakers farther out, we would hear the rippling laugh of some
small wave that, maybe, had crept in to listen to the tale the
landlord told.</p>
<p>The mistake that Charles Seabohn, junior partner of the firm
of Seabohn &amp; Son, civil engineers of London and
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and Mivanway Evans, youngest daughter of the
Rev. Thomas Evans, Pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Bristol,
made originally, was marrying too young.&nbsp; Charles Seabohn
could hardly have been twenty years of age, and Mivanway could
have been little more than seventeen, when they first met upon
the cliffs, two miles beyond the Cromlech Arms.&nbsp; Young
Charles Seabohn, coming across the village in the course of a
walking tour, had decided to spend a day or two exploring the
picturesque coast, and Mivanway&rsquo;s father had hired that
year a neighbouring farmhouse wherein to spend his summer
vacation.</p>
<p>Early one morning&mdash;for at twenty one is virtuous, and
takes exercise before breakfast&mdash;as young Charles Seabohn
lay upon the cliffs, watching the white waters coming and going
upon the black rocks below, he became aware of a form rising from
the waves.&nbsp; The figure was too far off for him to see it
clearly, but judging from the costume, it was a female figure,
and promptly the mind of Charles, poetically inclined, turned to
thoughts of Venus&mdash;or Aphrodite, as he, being a gentleman of
delicate taste would have preferred to term her.&nbsp; He saw the
figure disappear behind a head-land, but still waited.&nbsp; In
about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour it reappeared, clothed
in the garments of the eighteen-sixties, and came towards
him.&nbsp; Hidden from sight himself behind a group of rocks, he
could watch it at his leisure, ascending the steep path from the
beach, and an exceedingly sweet and dainty figure it would have
appeared, even to eyes less susceptible than those of
twenty.&nbsp; Sea-water&mdash;I stand open to correction&mdash;is
not, I believe, considered anything of a substitute for curling
tongs, but to the hair of the youngest Miss Evans it had given an
additional and most fascinating wave.&nbsp; Nature&rsquo;s red
and white had been most cunningly laid on, and the large childish
eyes seemed to be searching the world for laughter, with which to
feed a pair of delicious, pouting lips.&nbsp; Charles&rsquo;s
upturned face, petrified into admiration, was just the sort of
thing for which they were on the look-out.&nbsp; A startled
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; came from the slightly parted lips, followed by
the merriest of laughs, which in its turn was suddenly stopped by
a deep blush.&nbsp; Then the youngest Miss Evans looked offended,
as though the whole affair had been Charles&rsquo;s fault, which
is the way of women.&nbsp; And Charles, feeling himself guilty
under that stern gaze of indignation, rose awkwardly and
apologised meekly, whether for being on the cliffs at all or for
having got up too early, he would have been unable to
explain.</p>
<p>The youngest Miss Evans graciously accepted the apology thus
tendered with a bow, and passed on, and Charles stood staring
after her till the valley gathered her into its spreading arms
and hid her from his view.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of all things.&nbsp; I am speaking of
the Universe as viewed from the standpoint of Charles and
Mivanway.</p>
<p>Six months later they were man and wife, or perhaps it would
be more correct to say boy and wifelet.&nbsp; Seabohn senior
counselled delay, but was overruled by the impatience of his
junior partner.&nbsp; The Reverend Mr. Evans, in common with most
theologians, possessed a goodly supply of unmarried daughters,
and a limited income.&nbsp; Personally he saw no necessity for
postponement of the marriage.</p>
<p>The month&rsquo;s honeymoon was spent in the New Forest.&nbsp;
That was a mistake to begin with.&nbsp; The New Forest in
February is depressing, and they had chosen the loneliest spot
they could find.&nbsp; A fortnight in Paris or Rome would have
been more helpful.&nbsp; As yet they had nothing to talk about
except love, and that they had been talking and writing about
steadily all through the winter.&nbsp; On the tenth morning
Charles yawned, and Mivanway had a quiet half-hour&rsquo;s cry
about it in her own room.&nbsp; On the sixteenth evening,
Mivanway, feeling irritable, and wondering why (as though fifteen
damp, chilly days in the New Forest were not sufficient to make
any woman irritable), requested Charles not to disarrange her
hair; and Charles, speechless with astonishment, went out into
the garden, and swore before all the stars that he would never
caress Mivanway&rsquo;s hair again as long as he lived.</p>
<p>One supreme folly they had conspired to commit, even before
the commencement of the honeymoon.&nbsp; Charles, after the
manner of very young lovers, had earnestly requested Mivanway to
impose upon him some task.&nbsp; He desired to do something great
and noble to show his devotion.&nbsp; Dragons was the thing he
had in mind, though he may not have been aware of it.&nbsp;
Dragons also, no doubt, flitted through Mivanway&rsquo;s brain,
but unfortunately for lovers the supply of dragons has
lapsed.&nbsp; Mivanway, liking the conceit, however, thought over
it, and then decided that Charles must give up smoking.&nbsp; She
had discussed the matter with her favourite sister, and that was
the only thing the girls could think of.&nbsp; Charles&rsquo;s
face fell.&nbsp; He suggested some more Herculean labour, some
sacrifice more worthy to lay at Mivanway&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; But
Mivanway had spoken.&nbsp; She might think of some other task,
but the smoking prohibition would, in any case, remain.&nbsp; She
dismissed the subject with a pretty <i>hauteur</i> that would
have graced Marie Antoinette.</p>
<p>Thus tobacco, the good angel of all men, no longer came each
day to teach Charles patience and amiability, and he fell into
the ways of short temper and selfishness.</p>
<p>They took up their residence in a suburb of Newcastle, and
this was also unfortunate for them, because there the society was
scanty and middle-aged; and, in consequence, they had still to
depend much upon their own resources.&nbsp; They knew little of
life, less of each other, and nothing at all of themselves.&nbsp;
Of course they quarrelled, and each quarrel left the wound a
little more raw.&nbsp; No kindly, experienced friend was at hand
to laugh at them.&nbsp; Mivanway would write down all her sorrows
in a bulky diary, which made her feel worse; so that before she
had written for ten minutes her pretty, unwise head would drop
upon her dimpled arm, and the book&mdash;the proper place for
which was behind the fire&mdash;would become damp with her tears;
and Charles, his day&rsquo;s work done and the clerks gone, would
linger in his dingy office and hatch trifles into troubles.</p>
<p>The end came one evening after dinner, when, in the heat of a
silly squabble, Charles boxed Mivanway&rsquo;s ears.&nbsp; That
was very ungentlemanly conduct, and he was heartily ashamed of
himself the moment he had done it, which was right and proper for
him to be.&nbsp; The only excuse to be urged on his behalf is
that girls sufficiently pretty to have been spoilt from childhood
by everyone about them can at times be intensely
irritating.&nbsp; Mivanway rushed up to her room, and locked
herself in.&nbsp; Charles flew after her to apologise, but only
arrived in time to have the door slammed in his face.</p>
<p>It had only been the merest touch.&nbsp; A boy&rsquo;s muscles
move quicker than his thoughts.&nbsp; But to Mivanway it was a
blow.&nbsp; This was what it had come to!&nbsp; This was the end
of a man&rsquo;s love!</p>
<p>She spent half the night writing in the precious diary, with
the result that in the morning she came down feeling more bitter
than she had gone up.&nbsp; Charles had walked the streets of
Newcastle all night, and that had not done him any good.&nbsp; He
met her with an apology combined with an excuse, which was bad
tactics.&nbsp; Mivanway, of course, fastened upon the excuse, and
the quarrel recommenced.&nbsp; She mentioned that she hated him;
he hinted that she had never loved him, and she retorted that he
had never loved her.&nbsp; Had there been anybody by to knock
their heads together and suggest breakfast, the thing might have
blown over, but the combined effect of a sleepless night and an
empty stomach upon each proved disastrous.&nbsp; Their words came
poisoned from their brains, and each believed they meant what
they said.&nbsp; That afternoon Charles sailed from Hull, on a
ship bound for the Cape, and that evening Mivanway arrived at the
paternal home in Bristol with two trunks and the curt information
that she and Charles had separated for ever.&nbsp; The next
morning both thought of a soft speech to say to the other, but
the next morning was just twenty-four hours too late.</p>
<p>Eight days afterwards Charles&rsquo;s ship was run down in a
fog, near the coast of Portugal, and every soul on board was
supposed to have perished.&nbsp; Mivanway read his name among the
list of lost; the child died within her, and she knew herself for
a woman who had loved deeply, and will not love again.</p>
<p>Good luck intervening, however, Charles and one other man were
rescued by a small trading vessel, and landed in Algiers.&nbsp;
There Charles learnt of his supposed death, and the idea occurred
to him to leave the report uncontradicted.&nbsp; For one thing,
it solved a problem that had been troubling him.&nbsp; He could
trust his father to see to it that his own small fortune, with
possibly something added, was handed over to Mivanway, and she
would be free if she wished to marry again.&nbsp; He was
convinced that she did not care for him, and that she had read of
his death with a sense of relief.&nbsp; He would make a new life
for himself, and forget her.</p>
<p>He continued his journey to the Cape, and once there he soon
gained for himself an excellent position.&nbsp; The colony was
young, engineers were welcome, and Charles knew his
business.&nbsp; He found the life interesting and exciting.&nbsp;
The rough, dangerous up-country work suited him, and the time
passed swiftly.</p>
<p>But in thinking he would forget Mivanway, he had not taken
into consideration his own character, which at bottom was a very
gentlemanly character.&nbsp; Out on the lonely veldt he found
himself dreaming of her.&nbsp; The memory of her pretty face and
merry laugh came back to him at all hours.&nbsp; Occasionally he
would curse her roundly, but that only meant that he was sore
because of the thought of her; what he was really cursing was
himself and his own folly.&nbsp; Softened by the distance, her
quick temper, her very petulance became mere added graces; and if
we consider women as human beings and not as angels, it was
certainly a fact that he had lost a very sweet and lovable
woman.&nbsp; Ah! if she only were by his side now&mdash;now that
he was a man capable of appreciating her, and not a foolish,
selfish boy.&nbsp; This thought would come to him as he sat
smoking at the door of his tent, and then he would regret that
the stars looking down upon him were not the same stars that were
watching her, it would have made him feel nearer to her.&nbsp;
For, though young people may not credit it, one grows more
sentimental as one grows older; at least, some of us do, and they
perhaps not the least wise.</p>
<p>One night he had a vivid dream of her.&nbsp; She came to him
and held out her hand, and he took it, and they said good-bye to
one another.&nbsp; They were standing on the cliff where he had
first met her, and one of them was going upon a long journey,
though he was not sure which.</p>
<p>In the towns men laugh at dreams, but away from civilisation
we listen more readily to the strange tales that Nature whispers
to us.&nbsp; Charles Seabohn recollected this dream when he awoke
in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is dying,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and she has come
to wish me good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made up his mind to return to England at once; perhaps if
he made haste he would be in time to kiss her.&nbsp; But he could
not start that day, for work was to be done; and Charles Seabohn,
lover though he still was, had grown to be a man, and knew that
work must not be neglected even though the heart may be
calling.&nbsp; So for a day or two he stayed, and on the third
night he dreamed of Mivanway again, and this time she lay within
the little chapel at Bristol where, on Sunday mornings, he had
often sat with her.&nbsp; He heard her father&rsquo;s voice
reading the burial service over her, and the sister she had loved
best was sitting beside him, crying softly.&nbsp; Then Charles
knew that there was no need for him to hasten.&nbsp; So he
remained to finish his work.&nbsp; That done, he would return to
England.&nbsp; He would like again to stand upon the cliffs,
above the little Cornish village, where they had first met.</p>
<p>Thus a few months later Charles Seabohn, or Charles Denning,
as he called himself, aged and bronzed, not easily recognisable
by those who had not known him well, walked into the Cromlech
Arms, as six years before he had walked in with his knapsack on
his back, and asked for a room, saying he would be stopping in
the village for a short while.</p>
<p>In the evening he strolled out and made his way to the
cliffs.&nbsp; It was twilight when he reached the place of rocks
to which the fancy-loving Cornish folk had given the name of the
Witches&rsquo; Cauldron.&nbsp; It was from this spot that he had
first watched Mivanway coming to him from the sea.</p>
<p>He took the pipe from his mouth, and leaning against a rock,
whose rugged outline seemed fashioned into the face of an old
friend, gazed down the narrow pathway now growing indistinct in
the dim light.&nbsp; And as he gazed the figure of Mivanway came
slowly up the pathway from the sea, and paused before him.</p>
<p>He felt no fear.&nbsp; He had half expected it.&nbsp; Her
coming was the complement of his dreams.&nbsp; She looked older
and graver than he remembered her, but for that the face was the
sweeter.</p>
<p>He wondered if she would speak to him, but she only looked at
him with sad eyes; and he stood there in the shadow of the rocks
without moving, and she passed on into the twilight.</p>
<p>Had he on his return cared to discuss the subject with his
landlord, had he even shown himself a ready listener&mdash;for
the old man loved to gossip&mdash;he might have learnt that a
young widow lady named Mrs. Charles Seabohn, accompanied by an
unmarried sister, had lately come to reside in the neighbourhood,
having, upon the death of a former tenant, taken the lease of a
small farmhouse sheltered in the valley a mile beyond the
village, and that her favourite evening&rsquo;s walk was to the
sea and back by the steep footway leading past the Witches&rsquo;
Cauldron.</p>
<p>Had he followed the figure of Mivanway into the valley, he
would have known that out of sight of the Witches&rsquo; Cauldron
it took to running fast till it reached a welcome door, and fell
panting into the arms of another figure that had hastened out to
meet it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said the elder woman, &ldquo;you are
trembling like a leaf.&nbsp; What has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen him,&rdquo; answered Mivanway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles!&rdquo; repeated the other, looking at Mivanway
as though she thought her mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His spirit, I mean,&rdquo; explained Mivanway, in an
awed voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was standing in the shadow of the
rocks, in the exact spot where we first met.&nbsp; It looked
older and more careworn; but, oh! Margaret, so sad and
reproachful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said her sister, leading her in,
&ldquo;you are overwrought.&nbsp; I wish we had never come back
to this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I was not frightened,&rdquo; answered
Mivanway, &ldquo;I have been expecting it every evening.&nbsp; I
am so glad it came.&nbsp; Perhaps it will come again, and I can
ask it to forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So next night Mivanway, though much against her sister&rsquo;s
wishes and advice, persisted in her usual walk, and Charles at
the same twilight hour started from the inn.</p>
<p>Again Mivanway saw him standing in the shadow of the
rocks.&nbsp; Charles had made up his mind that if the thing
happened again he would speak, but when the silent figure of
Mivanway, clothed in the fading light, stopped and gazed at him,
his will failed him.</p>
<p>That it was the spirit of Mivanway standing before him he had
not the faintest doubt.&nbsp; One may dismiss other
people&rsquo;s ghosts as the phantasies of a weak brain, but one
knows one&rsquo;s own to be realities, and Charles for the last
five years had mingled with a people whose dead dwell about
them.&nbsp; Once, drawing his courage around him, he made to
speak, but as he did so the figure of Mivanway shrank from him,
and only a sigh escaped his lips, and hearing that the figure of
Mivanway turned and again passed down the path into the valley,
leaving Charles gazing after it.</p>
<p>But the third night both arrived at the trysting spot with
determination screwed up to the sticking point.</p>
<p>Charles was the first to speak.&nbsp; As the figure of
Mivanway came towards him, with its eyes fixed sadly on him, he
moved from the shadow of the rocks, and stood before it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mivanway!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles!&rdquo; replied the figure of Mivanway.&nbsp;
Both spoke in an awed whisper suitable to the circumstances, and
each stood gazing sorrowfully upon the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you happy?&rdquo; asked Mivanway.</p>
<p>The question strikes one as somewhat farcical, but it must be
remembered that Mivanway was the daughter of a Gospeller of the
old school, and had been brought up to beliefs that were not then
out of date.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As happy as I deserve to be,&rdquo; was the sad reply,
and the answer&mdash;the inference was not complimentary to
Charles&rsquo;s deserts&mdash;struck a chill to Mivanway&rsquo;s
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I be happy having lost you?&rdquo; went on
the voice of Charles.</p>
<p>Now this speech fell very pleasantly upon Mivanway&rsquo;s
ears.&nbsp; In the first place it relieved her of her despair
regarding Charles&rsquo;s future.&nbsp; No doubt his present
suffering was keen, but there was hope for him.&nbsp; Secondly,
it was a decidedly &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; speech for a ghost, and I
am not at all sure that Mivanway was the kind of woman to be
averse to a little mild flirtation with the spirit of
Charles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you forgive me?&rdquo; asked Mivanway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive <i>you</i>!&rdquo; replied Charles, in a tone
of awed astonishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you forgive me?&nbsp; I
was a brute&mdash;a fool&mdash;I was not worthy to love
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A most gentlemanly spirit it seemed to be.&nbsp; Mivanway
forgot to be afraid of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were both to blame,&rdquo; answered Mivanway.&nbsp;
But this time there was less submission in her tones.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I was the most at fault.&nbsp; I was a petulant
child.&nbsp; I did not know how deeply I loved you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You loved me!&rdquo; repeated the voice of Charles, and
the voice lingered over the words as though it found them
sweet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you never doubted it,&rdquo; answered the voice
of Mivanway.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never ceased to love you.&nbsp; I
shall love you always and ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figure of Charles sprang forward as though it would clasp
the ghost of Mivanway in its arms, but halted a step or two
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me before you go,&rdquo; he said, and with
uncovered head the figure of Charles knelt to the figure of
Mivanway.</p>
<p>Really, ghosts could be exceedingly nice when they
liked.&nbsp; Mivanway bent graciously towards her shadowy
suppliant, and, as she did so, her eye caught sight of something
on the grass beside it, and that something was a well-coloured
meerschaum pipe.&nbsp; There was no mistaking it for anything
else, even in that treacherous light; it lay glistening where
Charles, in falling upon his knees had jerked it from his
breast-pocket.</p>
<p>Charles, following Mivanway&rsquo;s eyes, saw it also, and the
memory of the prohibition against smoking came back to him.</p>
<p>Without stopping to consider the futility of the
action&mdash;nay, the direct confession implied thereby&mdash;he
instinctively grabbed at the pipe, and rammed it back into his
pocket; and then an avalanche of mingled understanding and
bewilderment, fear and joy, swept Mivanway&rsquo;s brain before
it.&nbsp; She felt she must do one of two things, laugh or scream
and go on screaming, and she laughed.&nbsp; Peal after peal of
laughter she sent echoing among the rocks, and Charles springing
to his feet was just in time to catch her as she fell forward a
dead weight into his arms.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the eldest Miss Evans, hearing heavy
footsteps, went to the door.&nbsp; She saw what she took to be
the spirit of Charles Seabohn, staggering under the weight of the
lifeless body of Mivanway, and the sight not unnaturally alarmed
her.&nbsp; Charles&rsquo;s suggestion of brandy, however, sounded
human, and the urgent need of attending to Mivanway kept her mind
from dwelling upon problems tending towards insanity.</p>
<p>Charles carried Mivanway to her room, and laid her upon the
bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave her with you,&rdquo; he whispered to
the eldest Miss Evans.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will be better for her not
to see me until she is quite recovered.&nbsp; She has had a
shock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles waited in the dark parlour for what seemed to him an
exceedingly long time.&nbsp; But at last the eldest Miss Evans
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right now,&rdquo; were the welcome
words he heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see her,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s in bed,&rdquo; exclaimed the
scandalised Miss Evans.</p>
<p>And then as Charles only laughed, &ldquo;Oh, ah&mdash;yes, I
suppose&mdash;of course,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>And the eldest Miss Evans, left alone, sat down and wrestled
with the conviction that she was dreaming.</p>
<h2>PORTRAIT OF A LADY</h2>
<p>My work pressed upon me, but the louder it challenged
me&mdash;such is the heart of the timid fighter&mdash;the less
stomach I felt for the contest.&nbsp; I wrestled with it in my
study, only to be driven to my books.&nbsp; I walked out to meet
it in the streets, only to seek shelter from it in music-hall or
theatre.&nbsp; Thereupon it waxed importunate and over-bearing,
till the shadow of it darkened all my doings.&nbsp; The thought
of it sat beside me at the table, and spoilt my appetite.&nbsp;
The memory of it followed me abroad, and stood between me and my
friends, so that all talk died upon my lips, and I moved among
men as one ghost-ridden.</p>
<p>Then the throbbing town, with its thousand distracting voices,
grew maddening to me.&nbsp; I felt the need of converse with
solitude, that master and teacher of all the arts, and I
bethought me of the Yorkshire Wolds, where a man may walk all
day, meeting no human creature, hearing no voice but the
curlew&rsquo;s cry; where, lying prone upon the sweet grass, he
may feel the pulsation of the earth, travelling at its eleven
hundred miles a minute through the ether.&nbsp; So one morning I
bundled many things, some needful, more needless, into a bag,
hurrying lest somebody or something should happen to stay me, and
that night I lay in a small northern town that stands upon the
borders of smokedom at the gate of the great moors; and at seven
the next morning I took my seat beside a one-eyed carrier behind
an ancient piebald mare.&nbsp; The one-eyed carrier cracked his
whip, the piebald horse jogged forward.&nbsp; The nineteenth
century, with its turmoil, fell away behind us; the distant
hills, creeping nearer, swallowed us up, and we became but a
moving speck upon the face of the quiet earth.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon we arrived at a village, the memory of
which had been growing in my mind.&nbsp; It lies in the triangle
formed by the sloping walls of three great fells, and not even
the telegraph wire has reached it yet, to murmur to it whispers
of the restless world&mdash;or had not at the time of which I
write.&nbsp; Nought disturbs it save, once a day, the one-eyed
carrier&mdash;if he and his piebald mare have not yet laid their
ancient bones to rest&mdash;who, passing through, leaves a few
letters and parcels to be called for by the people of the
scattered hill-farms round about.&nbsp; It is the meeting-place
of two noisy brooks.&nbsp; Through the sleepy days and the hushed
nights, one hears them ever chattering to themselves as children
playing alone some game of make-believe.&nbsp; Coming from their
far-off homes among the hills, they mingle their waters here, and
journey on in company, and then their converse is more serious,
as becomes those who have joined hands and are moving onward
towards life together.&nbsp; Later they reach sad, weary towns,
black beneath a never-lifted pall of smoke, where day and night
the clang of iron drowns all human voices, where the children
play with ashes, where the men and women have dull, patient
faces; and so on, muddy and stained, to the deep sea that
ceaselessly calls to them.&nbsp; Here, however, their waters are
fresh and clear, and their passing makes the only stir that the
valley has ever known.&nbsp; Surely, of all peaceful places, this
was the one where a tired worker might find strength.</p>
<p>My one-eyed friend had suggested I should seek lodgings at the
house of one Mistress Cholmondley, a widow lady, who resided with
her only daughter in the white-washed cottage that is the last
house in the village, if you take the road that leads over Coll
Fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tha&rsquo; can see th&rsquo; house from here, by reason
o&rsquo; its standing so high above t&rsquo;others,&rdquo; said
the carrier, pointing with his whip.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
theer or nowhere, aw&rsquo;m thinking, for folks don&rsquo;t
often coom seeking lodgings in these parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiny dwelling, half smothered in June roses, looked
idyllic, and after a lunch of bread and cheese at the little inn
I made my way to it by the path that passes through the
churchyard.&nbsp; I had conjured up the vision of a stout,
pleasant, comfort-radiating woman, assisted by some bright, fresh
girl, whose rosy cheeks and sunburnt hands would help me banish
from my mind all clogging recollections of the town; and hopeful,
I pushed back the half-opened door and entered.</p>
<p>The cottage was furnished with a taste that surprised me, but
in themselves my hosts disappointed me.&nbsp; My bustling, comely
housewife turned out a wizened, blear-eyed dame.&nbsp; All day
long she dozed in her big chair, or crouched with shrivelled
hands spread out before the fire.&nbsp; My dream of winsome
maidenhood vanished before the reality of a weary-looking,
sharp-featured woman of between forty and fifty.&nbsp; Perhaps
there had been a time when the listless eyes had sparkled with
roguish merriment, when the shrivelled, tight-drawn lips had
pouted temptingly; but spinsterhood does not sweeten the juices
of a woman, and strong country air, though, like old ale, it is
good when taken occasionally, dulls the brain if lived
upon.&nbsp; A narrow, uninteresting woman I found her, troubled
with a shyness that sat ludicrously upon her age, and that yet
failed to save her from the landlady&rsquo;s customary failing of
loquacity concerning &ldquo;better days,&rdquo; together with an
irritating, if harmless, affectation of youthfulness.</p>
<p>All other details were, however, most satisfactory; and at the
window commanding the road that leads through the valley towards
the distant world I settled down to face my work.</p>
<p>But the spirit of industry, once driven forth, returns with
coy steps.&nbsp; I wrote for perhaps an hour, and then throwing
down my halting pen I looked about the room, seeking
distraction.&nbsp; A Chippendale book-case stood against the wall
and I strolled over to it.&nbsp; The key was in the lock, and
opening its glass doors, I examined the well-filled
shelves.&nbsp; They held a curious collection: miscellanies with
quaint, glazed bindings; novels and poems; whose authors I had
never heard of; old magazines long dead, their very names
forgotten; &ldquo;keepsakes&rdquo; and annuals, redolent of an
age of vastly pretty sentiments and lavender-coloured
silks.&nbsp; On the top shelf, however, was a volume of Keats
wedged between a number of the <i>Evangelical Rambler</i> and
Young&rsquo;s <i>Night Thoughts</i>, and standing on tip-toe, I
sought to draw it from its place.</p>
<p>The book was jambed so tightly that my efforts brought two or
three others tumbling about me, covering me with a cloud of fine
dust, and to my feet there fell, with a rattle of glass and
metal, a small miniature painting, framed in black wood.</p>
<p>I picked it up, and, taking it to the window, examined
it.&nbsp; It was the picture of a young girl, dressed in the
fashion of thirty years ago&mdash;I mean thirty years ago
then.&nbsp; I fear it must be nearer fifty, speaking as from
now&mdash;when our grandmothers wore corkscrew curls, and low-cut
bodices that one wonders how they kept from slipping down.&nbsp;
The face was beautiful, not merely with the conventional beauty
of tiresome regularity and impossible colouring such as one finds
in all miniatures, but with soul behind the soft deep eyes.&nbsp;
As I gazed, the sweet lips seemed to laugh at me, and yet there
lurked a sadness in the smile, as though the artist, in some rare
moment, had seen the coming shadow of life across the sunshine of
the face.&nbsp; Even my small knowledge of Art told me that the
work was clever, and I wondered why it should have lain so long
neglected, when as a mere ornament it was valuable.&nbsp; It must
have been placed in the book-case years ago by someone, and
forgotten.</p>
<p>I replaced it among its dusty companions, and sat down once
more to my work.&nbsp; But between me and the fading light came
the face of the miniature, and would not be banished.&nbsp;
Wherever I turned it looked out at me from the shadows.&nbsp; I
am not naturally fanciful, and the work I was engaged
upon&mdash;the writing of a farcical comedy&mdash;was not of the
kind to excite the dreamy side of a man&rsquo;s nature.&nbsp; I
grew angry with myself, and made a further effort to fix my mind
upon the paper in front of me.&nbsp; But my thoughts refused to
return from their wanderings.&nbsp; Once, glancing back over my
shoulder, I could have sworn I saw the original of the picture
sitting in the big chintz-covered chair in the far corner.&nbsp;
It was dressed in a faded lilac frock, trimmed with some old
lace, and I could not help noticing the beauty of the folded
hands, though in the portrait only the head and shoulders had
been drawn.</p>
<p>Next morning I had forgotten the incident, but with the
lighting of the lamp the memory of it awoke within me, and my
interest grew so strong that again I took the miniature from its
hiding-place and looked at it.</p>
<p>And then the knowledge suddenly came to me that I knew the
face.&nbsp; Where had I seen her, and when?&nbsp; I had met her
and spoken to her.&nbsp; The picture smiled at me, as if rallying
me on my forgetfulness.&nbsp; I put it back upon its shelf, and
sat racking my brains trying to recollect.&nbsp; We had met
somewhere&mdash;in the country&mdash;a long time ago, and had
talked of common-place things.&nbsp; To the vision of her clung
the scent of roses and the murmuring voices of haymakers.&nbsp;
Why had I never seen her again?&nbsp; Why had she passed so
completely out of my mind?</p>
<p>My landlady entered to lay my supper, and I questioned her
assuming a careless tone.&nbsp; Reason with or laugh at myself as
I would, this shadowy memory was becoming a romance to me.&nbsp;
It was as though I were talking of some loved, dead friend, even
to speak of whom to commonplace people was a sacrilege.&nbsp; I
did not want the woman to question me in return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; answered my landlady.&nbsp; Ladies had
often lodged with her.&nbsp; Sometimes people stayed the whole
summer, wandering about the woods and fells, but to her thinking
the great hills were lonesome.&nbsp; Some of her lodgers had been
young ladies, but she could not remember any of them having
impressed her with their beauty.&nbsp; But then it was said women
were never a judge of other women.&nbsp; They had come and
gone.&nbsp; Few had ever returned, and fresh faces drove out the
old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been letting lodgings for a long time?&rdquo;
I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose it could be fifteen&mdash;twenty
years ago that strangers to you lived in this room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Longer than that,&rdquo; she said quietly, dropping for
the moment all affectation.&nbsp; &ldquo;We came here from the
farm when my father died.&nbsp; He had had losses, and there was
but little left.&nbsp; That is twenty-seven years ago
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hastened to close the conversation, fearing long-winded
recollections of &ldquo;better days.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have heard
such so often from one landlady and another.&nbsp; I had not
learnt much.&nbsp; Who was the original of the miniature, how it
came to be lying forgotten in the dusty book-case were still
mysteries; and with a strange perversity I could not have
explained to myself I shrank from putting a direct question.</p>
<p>So two days more passed by.&nbsp; My work took gradually a
firmer grip upon my mind, and the face of the miniature visited
me less often.&nbsp; But in the evening of the third day, which
was a Sunday, a curious thing happened.</p>
<p>I was returning from a stroll, and dusk was falling as I
reached the cottage.&nbsp; I had been thinking of my farce, and I
was laughing to myself at a situation that seemed to me comical,
when, passing the window of my room, I saw looking out the sweet
fair face that had become so familiar to me.&nbsp; It stood close
to the latticed panes, a slim, girlish figure, clad in the
old-fashioned lilac-coloured frock in which I had imagined it on
the first night of my arrival, the beautiful hands clasped across
the breast, as then they had been folded on the lap.&nbsp; Her
eyes were gazing down the road that passes through the village
and goes south, but they seemed to be dreaming, not seeing, and
the sadness in them struck upon one almost as a cry.&nbsp; I was
close to the window, but the hedge screened me, and I remained
watching, until, after a minute I suppose, though it appeared
longer, the figure drew back into the darkness of the room and
disappeared.</p>
<p>I entered, but the room was empty.&nbsp; I called, but no one
answered.&nbsp; The uncomfortable suggestion took hold of me that
I must be growing a little crazy.&nbsp; All that had gone before
I could explain to myself as a mere train of thought, but this
time it had come to me suddenly, uninvited, while my thoughts had
been busy elsewhere.&nbsp; This thing had appeared not to my
brain but to my senses.&nbsp; I am not a believer in ghosts, but
I am in the hallucinations of a weak mind, and my own explanation
was in consequence not very satisfactory to myself.</p>
<p>I tried to dismiss the incident, but it would not leave me,
and later that same evening something else occurred that fixed it
still clearer in my thoughts.&nbsp; I had taken out two or three
books at random with which to amuse myself, and turning over the
leaves of one of them, a volume of verses by some obscure poet, I
found its sentimental passages much scored and commented upon in
pencil as was common fifty years ago&mdash;as may be common now,
for your Fleet Street cynic has not altered the world and its
ways to quite the extent that he imagines.</p>
<p>One poem in particular had evidently appealed greatly to the
reader&rsquo;s sympathies.&nbsp; It was the old, old story of the
gallant who woos and rides away, leaving the maiden to
weep.&nbsp; The poetry was poor, and at another time its
conventionality would have excited only my ridicule.&nbsp; But,
reading it in conjunction with the quaint, naive notes scattered
about its margins, I felt no inclination to jeer.&nbsp; These
hackneyed stories that we laugh at are deep profundities to the
many who find in them some shadow of their own sorrows, and
she&mdash;for it was a woman&rsquo;s handwriting&mdash;to whom
this book belonged had loved its trite verses, because in them
she had read her own heart.&nbsp; This, I told myself, was her
story also.&nbsp; A common enough story in life as in literature,
but novel to those who live it.</p>
<p>There was no reason for my connecting her with the original of
the miniature, except perhaps a subtle relationship between the
thin nervous handwriting and the mobile features; yet I felt
instinctively they were one and the same, and that I was tracing,
link by link, the history of my forgotten friend.</p>
<p>I felt urged to probe further, and next morning while my
landlady was clearing away my breakfast things, I fenced round
the subject once again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;while I think of it,
if I leave any books or papers here behind me, send them on at
once.&nbsp; I have a knack of doing that sort of thing.&nbsp; I
suppose,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;your lodgers often do leave some
of their belongings behind them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It sounded to myself a clumsy ruse.&nbsp; I wondered if she
would suspect what was behind it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not often,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never that
I can remember, except in the case of one poor lady who died
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced up quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this room?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>My landlady seemed troubled at my tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly in this very room.&nbsp; We carried
her upstairs, but she died immediately.&nbsp; She was dying when
she came here.&nbsp; I should not have taken her in had I
known.&nbsp; So many people are prejudiced against a house where
death has occurred, as if there were anywhere it had not.&nbsp;
It was not quite fair to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not speak for a while, and the rattle of the plates and
knives continued undisturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she leave here?&rdquo; I asked at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just a few books and photographs, and such-like
small things that people bring with them to lodgings,&rdquo; was
the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her people promised to send for them, but
they never did, and I suppose I forgot them.&nbsp; They were not
of any value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman turned as she was leaving the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t drive you away, sir, I hope, what I have
told you,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It all happened a long
while ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
interested me, that was all.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the woman went out,
closing the door behind her.</p>
<p>So here was the explanation, if I chose to accept it.&nbsp; I
sat long that morning, wondering to myself whether things I had
learnt to laugh at could be after all realities.&nbsp; And a day
or two afterwards I made a discovery that confirmed all my vague
surmises.</p>
<p>Rummaging through this same dusty book-case, I found in one of
the ill-fitting drawers, beneath a heap of torn and tumbled
books, a diary belonging to the fifties, stuffed with many
letters and shapeless flowers, pressed between stained pages; and
there&mdash;for the writer of stories, tempted by human
documents, is weak&mdash;in faded ink, brown and withered like
the flowers, I read the story I already knew.</p>
<p>Such a very old story it was, and so conventional.&nbsp; He
was an artist&mdash;was ever story of this type written where the
hero was not an artist?&nbsp; They had been children together,
loving each other without knowing it till one day it was revealed
to them.&nbsp; Here is the entry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;May 18th.&mdash;I do not know what to say,
or how to begin.&nbsp; Chris loves me.&nbsp; I have been praying
to God to make me worthy of him, and dancing round the room in my
bare feet for fear of waking them below.&nbsp; He kissed my hands
and clasped them round his neck, saying they were beautiful as
the hands of a goddess, and he knelt and kissed them again.&nbsp;
I am holding them before me and kissing them myself.&nbsp; I am
glad they are so beautiful.&nbsp; O God, why are you so good to
me?&nbsp; Help me to be a true wife to him.&nbsp; Help me that I
may never give him an instant&rsquo;s pain!&nbsp; Oh, that I had
more power of loving, that I might love him
better,&rdquo;&mdash;and thus foolish thoughts for many pages,
but foolish thoughts of the kind that has kept this worn old
world, hanging for so many ages in space, from turning sour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, in February, there is another entry that carries on the
story:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Chris left this morning.&nbsp; He put a
little packet into my hands at the last moment, saying it was the
most precious thing he possessed, and that when I looked at it I
was to think of him who loved it.&nbsp; Of course I guessed what
it was, but I did not open it till I was alone in my room.&nbsp;
It is the picture of myself that he has been so secret about, but
oh, so beautiful.&nbsp; I wonder if I am really as beautiful as
this.&nbsp; But I wish he had not made me look so sad.&nbsp; I am
kissing the little lips.&nbsp; I love them, because he loved to
kiss them.&nbsp; Oh, sweetheart! it will be long before you kiss
them again.&nbsp; Of course it was right for him to go, and I am
glad he has been able to manage it.&nbsp; He could not study
properly in this quiet country place, and now he will be able to
go to Paris and Rome and he will be great.&nbsp; Even the stupid
people here see how clever he is.&nbsp; But, oh, it will be so
long before I see him again, my love! my king!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With each letter that comes from him, similar foolish
rhapsodies are written down, but these letters of his, I gather,
as I turn the pages, grow after a while colder and fewer, and a
chill fear that dare not be penned creeps in among the words.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;March 12th.&nbsp; Six weeks and no letter
from Chris, and, oh dear! I am so hungry for one, for the last I
have almost kissed to pieces.&nbsp; I suppose he will write more
often when he gets to London.&nbsp; He is working hard, I know,
and it is selfish of me to expect him to write more often, but I
would sit up all night for a week rather than miss writing to
him.&nbsp; I suppose men are not like that.&nbsp; O God, help me,
help me, whatever happens!&nbsp; How foolish I am to-night!&nbsp;
He was always careless.&nbsp; I will punish him for it when he
comes back, but not very much.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truly enough a conventional story.</p>
<p>Letters do come from him after that, but apparently they are
less and less satisfactory, for the diary grows angry and bitter,
and the faded writing is blotted at times with tears.&nbsp; Then
towards the end of another year there comes this entry, written
in a hand of strange neatness and precision:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is all over now.&nbsp; I am glad it is
finished.&nbsp; I have written to him, giving him up.&nbsp; I
have told him I have ceased to care for him, and that it is
better we should both be free.&nbsp; It is best that way.&nbsp;
He would have had to ask me to release him, and that would have
given him pain.&nbsp; He was always gentle.&nbsp; Now he will be
able to marry her with an easy conscience, and he need never know
what I have suffered.&nbsp; She is more fitted for him than I
am.&nbsp; I hope he will be happy.&nbsp; I think I have done the
right thing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few lines follow, left blank, and then the writing is
resumed, but in a stronger, more vehement hand.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Why do I lie to myself?&nbsp; I hate
her!&nbsp; I would kill her if I could.&nbsp; I hope she will
make him wretched, and that he will come to hate her as I do, and
that she will die!&nbsp; Why did I let them persuade me to send
that lying letter?&nbsp; He will show it to her, and she will see
through it and laugh at me.&nbsp; I could have held him to his
promise; he could not have got out of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I care about dignity, and womanliness, and
right, and all the rest of the canting words!&nbsp; I want
him.&nbsp; I want his kisses and his arms about me.&nbsp; He is
mine!&nbsp; He loved me once!&nbsp; I have only given him up
because I thought it a fine thing to play the saint.&nbsp; It is
only an acted lie.&nbsp; I would rather be evil, and he loved
me.&nbsp; Why do I deceive myself?&nbsp; I want him.&nbsp; I care
for nothing else at the bottom of my heart&mdash;his love, his
kisses!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And towards the end.&nbsp; &ldquo;My God, what am I
saying?&nbsp; Have I no shame, no strength?&nbsp; O God, help
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And there the diary closes.</p>
<p>I looked among the letters lying between the pages of the
book.&nbsp; Most of them were signed simply &ldquo;Chris.&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Christopher.&rdquo;&nbsp; But one gave his name in
full, and it was a name I know well as that of a famous man,
whose hand I have often shaken.&nbsp; I thought of his
hard-featured, handsome wife, and of his great chill place, half
house, half exhibition, in Kensington, filled constantly with its
smart, chattering set, among whom he seemed always to be the
uninvited guest; of his weary face and bitter tongue.&nbsp; And
thinking thus there rose up before me the sweet, sad face of the
woman of the miniature, and, meeting her eyes as she smiled at me
from out of the shadows, I looked at her my wonder.</p>
<p>I took the miniature from its shelf.&nbsp; There would be no
harm now in learning her name.&nbsp; So I stood with it in my
hand till a little later my landlady entered to lay the
cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tumbled this out of your book-case,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;in reaching down some books.&nbsp; It is someone I know,
someone I have met, but I cannot think where.&nbsp; Do you know
who it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman took it from my hand, and a faint flush crossed her
withered face.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had lost it,&rdquo; she
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never thought of looking there.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a portrait of myself, painted years ago, by a
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked from her to the miniature, as she stood among the
shadows, with the lamplight falling on her face, and saw her
perhaps for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How stupid of me,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
I see the likeness now.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>THE MAN WHO WOULD MANAGE</h2>
<p>It has been told me by those in a position to know&mdash;and I
can believe it&mdash;that at nineteen months of age he wept
because his grandmother would not allow him to feed her with a
spoon, and that at three and a half he was fished, in an
exhausted condition, out of the water-butt, whither he had
climbed for the purpose of teaching a frog to swim.</p>
<p>Two years later he permanently injured his left eye, showing
the cat how to carry kittens without hurting them, and about the
same period was dangerously stung by a bee while conveying it
from a flower where, as it seemed to him, it was only wasting its
time, to one more rich in honey-making properties.</p>
<p>His desire was always to help others.&nbsp; He would spend
whole mornings explaining to elderly hens how to hatch eggs, and
would give up an afternoon&rsquo;s black-berrying to sit at home
and crack nuts for his pet squirrel.&nbsp; Before he was seven he
would argue with his mother upon the management of children, and
reprove his father for the way he was bringing him up.</p>
<p>As a child nothing could afford him greater delight than
&ldquo;minding&rdquo; other children, or them less.&nbsp; He
would take upon himself this harassing duty entirely of his own
accord, without hope of reward or gratitude.&nbsp; It was
immaterial to him whether the other children were older than
himself or younger, stronger or weaker, whenever and wherever he
found them he set to work to &ldquo;mind&rdquo; them.&nbsp; Once,
during a school treat, piteous cries were heard coming from a
distant part of the wood, and upon search being made, he was
discovered prone upon the ground, with a cousin of his, a boy
twice his own weight, sitting upon him and steadily whacking
him.&nbsp; Having rescued him, the teacher said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you keep with the little boys?&nbsp;
What are you doing along with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, sir,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;I was
minding him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would have &ldquo;minded&rdquo; Noah if he had got hold of
him.</p>
<p>He was a good-natured lad, and at school he was always willing
for the whole class to copy from his slate&mdash;indeed he would
urge them to do so.&nbsp; He meant it kindly, but inasmuch as his
answers were invariably quite wrong&mdash;with a distinctive and
inimitable wrongness peculiar to himself&mdash;the result to his
followers was eminently unsatisfactory; and with the shallowness
of youth that, ignoring motives, judges solely from results, they
would wait for him outside and punch him.</p>
<p>All his energies went to the instruction of others, leaving
none for his own purposes.&nbsp; He would take callow youths to
his chambers and teach them to box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, try and hit me on the nose,&rdquo; he would say,
standing before them in an attitude of defence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid.&nbsp; Hit as hard as ever you
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they would do it.&nbsp; And so soon as he had recovered
from his surprise, and a little lessened the bleeding, he would
explain to them how they had done it all wrong, and how easily he
could have stopped the blow if they had only hit him
properly.</p>
<p>Twice at golf he lamed himself for over a week, showing a
novice how to &ldquo;drive&rdquo;; and at cricket on one occasion
I remember seeing his middle stump go down like a ninepin just as
he was explaining to the bowler how to get the balls in
straight.&nbsp; After which he had a long argument with the
umpire as to whether he was in or out.</p>
<p>He has been known, during a stormy Channel passage, to rush
excitedly upon the bridge in order to inform the captain that he
had &ldquo;just seen a light about two miles away to the
left&rdquo;; and if he is on the top of an omnibus he generally
sits beside the driver, and points out to him the various
obstacles likely to impede their progress.</p>
<p>It was upon an omnibus that my own personal acquaintanceship
with him began.&nbsp; I was sitting behind two ladies when the
conductor came up to collect fares.&nbsp; One of them handed him
a sixpence telling him to take to Piccadilly Circus, which was
twopence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the other lady to her friend, handing
the man a shilling, &ldquo;I owe you sixpence, you give me
fourpence and I&rsquo;ll pay for the two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conductor took the shilling, punched two twopenny tickets,
and then stood trying to think it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said the lady who had spoken
last, &ldquo;give my friend fourpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conductor did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you give that fourpence to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The friend handed it to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; she concluded to the conductor,
&ldquo;give me eightpence, then we shall be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conductor doled out to her the eightpence&mdash;the
sixpence he had taken from the first lady, with a penny and two
halfpennies out of his own bag&mdash;distrustfully, and retired,
muttering something about his duties not including those of a
lightning calculator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the elder lady to the younger,
&ldquo;I owe you a shilling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I deemed the incident closed, when suddenly a florid gentleman
on the opposite seat called out in stentorian tones:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, conductor! you&rsquo;ve cheated these ladies out of
fourpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Oo&rsquo;s cheated &rsquo;oo out &rsquo;o
fourpence?&rdquo; replied the indignant conductor from the top of
the steps, &ldquo;it was a twopenny fare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two twopences don&rsquo;t make eightpence,&rdquo;
retorted the florid gentleman hotly.&nbsp; &ldquo;How much did
you give the fellow, my dear?&rdquo; he asked, addressing the
first of the young ladies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave him sixpence,&rdquo; replied the lady, examining
her purse.&nbsp; &ldquo;And then I gave you fourpence, you
know,&rdquo; she added, addressing her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a dear two pen&rsquo;oth,&rdquo; chimed in
a common-looking man on the seat behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s impossible, dear,&rdquo; returned the
other, &ldquo;because I owed you sixpence to begin
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I did,&rdquo; persisted the first lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gave me a shilling,&rdquo; said the conductor, who
had returned, pointing an accusing forefinger at the elder of the
ladies.</p>
<p>The elder lady nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I gave you sixpence and two pennies, didn&rsquo;t
I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady admitted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I give &rsquo;er&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed
towards the younger lady&mdash;&ldquo;fourpence, didn&rsquo;t
I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which I gave you, you know, dear,&rdquo; remarked the
younger lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blow me if it ain&rsquo;t <i>me</i> as &rsquo;as been
cheated out of the fourpence,&rdquo; cried the conductor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the florid gentleman, &ldquo;the other
lady gave you sixpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which I give to &rsquo;er,&rdquo; replied the
conductor, again pointing the finger of accusation at the elder
lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can search my bag if yer like.&nbsp; I
ain&rsquo;t got a bloomin&rsquo; sixpence on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time everybody had forgotten what they had done, and
contradicted themselves and one another.&nbsp; The florid man
took it upon himself to put everybody right, with the result that
before Piccadilly Circus was reached three passengers had
threatened to report the conductor for unbecoming language.&nbsp;
The conductor had called a policeman and had taken the names and
addresses of the two ladies, intending to sue them for the
fourpence (which they wanted to pay, but which the florid man
would not allow them to do); the younger lady had become
convinced that the elder lady had meant to cheat her, and the
elder lady was in tears.</p>
<p>The florid gentleman and myself continued to Charing Cross
Station.&nbsp; At the booking office window it transpired that we
were bound for the same suburb, and we journeyed down
together.&nbsp; He talked about the fourpence all the way.</p>
<p>At my gate we shook hands, and he was good enough to express
delight at the discovery that we were near neighbours.&nbsp; What
attracted him to myself I failed to understand, for he had bored
me considerably, and I had, to the best of my ability, snubbed
him.&nbsp; Subsequently I learned that it was a peculiarity of
his to be charmed with anyone who did not openly insult him.</p>
<p>Three days afterwards he burst into my study
unannounced&mdash;he appeared to regard himself as my bosom
friend&mdash;and asked me to forgive him for not having called
sooner, which I did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met the postman as I was coming along,&rdquo; he
said, handing me a blue envelope, &ldquo;and he gave me this, for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw it was an application for the water-rate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must make a stand against this,&rdquo; he
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for water to the 29th
September.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve no right to pay it in
June.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I replied to the effect that water-rates had to be paid, and
that it seemed to me immaterial whether they were paid in June or
September.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s the principle of the thing.&nbsp; Why should
you pay for water you have never had?&nbsp; What right have they
to bully you into paying what you don&rsquo;t owe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a fluent talker, and I was ass enough to listen to
him.&nbsp; By the end of half an hour he had persuaded me that
the question was bound up with the inalienable rights of man, and
that if I paid that fourteen and tenpence in June instead of in
September, I should be unworthy of the privileges my forefathers
had fought and died to bestow upon me.</p>
<p>He told me the company had not a leg to stand upon, and at his
instigation I sat down and wrote an insulting letter to the
chairman.</p>
<p>The secretary replied that, having regard to the attitude I
had taken up, it would be incumbent upon themselves to treat it
as a test case, and presumed that my solicitors would accept
service on my behalf.</p>
<p>When I showed him this letter he was delighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave it to me,&rdquo; he said, pocketing the
correspondence, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll teach them a
lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I left it to him.&nbsp; My only excuse is that at the time I
was immersed in the writing of what in those days was termed a
comedy-drama.&nbsp; The little sense I possessed must, I suppose,
have been absorbed by the play.</p>
<p>The magistrate&rsquo;s decision somewhat damped my ardour, but
only inflamed his zeal.&nbsp; Magistrates, he said, were
muddle-headed old fogies.&nbsp; This was a matter for a
judge.</p>
<p>The judge was a kindly old gentleman, and said that bearing in
mind the unsatisfactory wording of the sub-clause, he did not
think he could allow the company their costs, so that, all told,
I got off for something under fifty pounds, inclusive of the
original fourteen and tenpence.</p>
<p>Afterwards our friendship waned, but living as we did in the
same outlying suburb, I was bound to see a good deal of him; and
to hear more.</p>
<p>At parties of all kinds he was particularly prominent, and on
such occasions, being in his most good-natured mood, was most to
be dreaded.&nbsp; No human being worked harder for the enjoyment
of others, or produced more universal wretchedness.</p>
<p>One Christmas afternoon, calling upon a friend, I found some
fourteen or fifteen elderly ladies and gentlemen trotting
solemnly round a row of chairs in the centre of the drawing-room
while Poppleton played the piano.&nbsp; Every now and then
Poppleton would suddenly cease, and everyone would drop wearily
into the nearest chair, evidently glad of a rest; all but one,
who would thereupon creep quietly away, followed by the envying
looks of those left behind.&nbsp; I stood by the door watching
the weird scene.&nbsp; Presently an escaped player came towards
me, and I enquired of him what the ceremony was supposed to
signify.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; he answered grumpily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Some of Poppleton&rsquo;s damned tomfoolery.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then he added savagely, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to play forfeits
after this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant was still waiting a favourable opportunity to
announce me.&nbsp; I gave her a shilling not to, and got away
unperceived.</p>
<p>After a satisfactory dinner, he would suggest an impromptu
dance, and want you to roll up mats, or help him move the piano
to the other end of the room.</p>
<p>He knew enough round games to have started a small purgatory
of his own.&nbsp; Just as you were in the middle of an
interesting discussion, or a delightful
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with a pretty woman, he
would swoop down upon you with: &ldquo;Come along, we&rsquo;re
going to play literary consequences,&rdquo; and dragging you to
the table, and putting a piece of paper and a pencil before you,
would tell you to write a description of your favourite heroine
in fiction, and would see that you did it.</p>
<p>He never spared himself.&nbsp; It was always he who would
volunteer to escort the old ladies to the station, and who would
never leave them until he had seen them safely into the wrong
train.&nbsp; He it was who would play &ldquo;wild beasts&rdquo;
with the children, and frighten them into fits that would last
all night.</p>
<p>So far as intention went, he was the kindest man alive.&nbsp;
He never visited poor sick persons without taking with him in his
pocket some little delicacy calculated to disagree with them and
make them worse.&nbsp; He arranged yachting excursions for bad
sailors, entirely at his own expense, and seemed to regard their
subsequent agonies as ingratitude.</p>
<p>He loved to manage a wedding.&nbsp; Once he planned matters so
that the bride arrived at the altar three-quarters of an hour
before the groom, which led to unpleasantness upon a day that
should have been filled only with joy, and once he forgot the
clergyman.&nbsp; But he was always ready to admit when he made a
mistake.</p>
<p>At funerals, also, he was to the fore, pointing out to the
grief-stricken relatives how much better it was for all concerned
that the corpse was dead, and expressing a pious hope that they
would soon join it.</p>
<p>The chiefest delight of his life, however, was to be mixed up
in other people&rsquo;s domestic quarrels.&nbsp; No domestic
quarrel for miles round was complete without him.&nbsp; He
generally came in as mediator, and finished as leading witness
for the appellant.</p>
<p>As a journalist or politician his wonderful grasp of other
people&rsquo;s business would have won for him esteem.&nbsp; The
error he made was working it out in practice.</p>
<h2>THE MAN WHO LIVED FOR OTHERS</h2>
<p>The first time we met, to speak, he was sitting with his back
against a pollard willow, smoking a clay pipe.&nbsp; He smoked it
very slowly, but very conscientiously.&nbsp; After each whiff he
removed the pipe from his mouth and fanned away the smoke with
his cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feeling bad?&rdquo; I asked from behind a tree, at the
same time making ready for a run, big boys&rsquo; answers to
small boys&rsquo; impertinences being usually of the nature of
things best avoided.</p>
<p>To my surprise and relief&mdash;for at second glance I
perceived I had under-estimated the length of his legs&mdash;he
appeared to regard the question as a natural and proper one,
replying with unaffected candour, &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My desire became to comfort him&mdash;a sentiment I think he
understood and was grateful for.&nbsp; Advancing into the open, I
sat down over against him, and watched him for a while in
silence.&nbsp; Presently he said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever tried drinking beer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I admitted I had not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is beastly stuff,&rdquo; he rejoined with an
involuntary shudder.</p>
<p>Rendered forgetful of present trouble by bitter recollection
of the past, he puffed away at his pipe carelessly and without
judgment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you often drink it?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied gloomily; &ldquo;all we fellows
in the fifth form drink beer and smoke pipes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A deeper tinge of green spread itself over his face.</p>
<p>He rose suddenly and made towards the hedge.&nbsp; Before he
reached it, however, he stopped and addressed me, but without
turning round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you follow me, young &rsquo;un, or look, I&rsquo;ll
punch your head,&rdquo; he said swiftly, and disappeared with a
gurgle.</p>
<p>He left at the end of the term and I did not see him again
until we were both young men.&nbsp; Then one day I ran against
him in Oxford Street, and he asked me to come and spend a few
days with his people in Surrey.</p>
<p>I found him wan-looking and depressed, and every now and then
he sighed.&nbsp; During a walk across the common he cheered up
considerably, but the moment we got back to the house door he
seemed to recollect himself, and began to sigh again.&nbsp; He
ate no dinner whatever, merely sipping a glass of wine and
crumbling a piece of bread.&nbsp; I was troubled at noticing
this, but his relatives&mdash;a maiden aunt, who kept house, two
elder sisters, and a weak-eyed female cousin who had left her
husband behind her in India&mdash;were evidently charmed.&nbsp;
They glanced at each other, and nodded and smiled.&nbsp; Once in
a fit of abstraction he swallowed a bit of crust, and immediately
they all looked pained and surprised.</p>
<p>In the drawing-room, under cover of a sentimental song, sung
by the female cousin, I questioned his aunt on the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is he ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be like that one day,&rdquo; she whispered
gleefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When,&rdquo; I asked, not unnaturally alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re in love,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is <i>he</i> in love?&rdquo; I inquired after a
pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see he is?&rdquo; she replied somewhat
scornfully.</p>
<p>I was a young man, and interested in the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t he ever eat any dinner till he&rsquo;s got
over it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>She looked round sharply at me, but apparently decided that I
was only foolish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait till your time comes,&rdquo; she answered,
shaking her curls at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t care much
about your dinner&mdash;not if you are <i>really</i> in
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the night, about half-past eleven, I heard, as I thought,
footsteps in the passage, and creeping to the door and opening it
I saw the figure of my friend in dressing-gown and slippers,
vanishing down the stairs.&nbsp; My idea was that, his brain
weakened by trouble, he had developed sleep-walking
tendencies.&nbsp; Partly out of curiosity, partly to watch over
him, I slipped on a pair of trousers and followed him.</p>
<p>He placed his candle on the kitchen table and made a bee-line
for the pantry door, from where he subsequently emerged with two
pounds of cold beef on a plate and about a quart of beer in a
jug; and I came away, leaving him fumbling for pickles.</p>
<p>I assisted at his wedding, where it seemed to me he
endeavoured to display more ecstasy than it was possible for any
human being to feel; and fifteen months later, happening to catch
sight of an advertisement in the births column of <i>The
Times</i>, I called on my way home from the City to congratulate
him.&nbsp; He was pacing up and down the passage with his hat on,
pausing at intervals to partake of an uninviting-looking meal,
consisting of a cold mutton chop and a glass of lemonade, spread
out upon a chair.&nbsp; Seeing that the cook and the housemaid
were wandering about the house evidently bored for want of
something to do, and that the dining-room, where he would have
been much more out of the way, was empty and quite in order, I
failed at first to understand the reason for his deliberate
choice of discomfort.&nbsp; I, however, kept my reflections to
myself, and inquired after the mother and child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be better,&rdquo; he replied with a
groan.&nbsp; &ldquo;The doctor said he&rsquo;d never had a more
satisfactory case in all his experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m glad to hear that,&rdquo; I answered;
&ldquo;I was afraid you&rsquo;d been worrying
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worried!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear boy,
I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;m standing on my head or my
heels&rdquo; (he gave one that idea).&nbsp; &ldquo;This is the
first morsel of food that&rsquo;s passed my lips for twenty-four
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the nurse appeared at the top of the
stairs.&nbsp; He flew towards her, upsetting the lemonade in his
excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked hoarsely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
it all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady glanced from him to his cold chop, and smiled
approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re doing splendidly,&rdquo; she answered,
patting him on the shoulder in a motherly fashion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, Mrs. Jobson,&rdquo; he replied,
sitting down upon the bottom stair, and leaning his head against
the banisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jobson
admiringly; &ldquo;and you wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a man if you
could.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then it was borne in upon me why he wore his
hat, and dined off cold chops in the passage.</p>
<p>The following summer they rented a picturesque old house in
Berkshire, and invited me down from a Saturday to Monday.&nbsp;
Their place was near the river, so I slipped a suit of flannels
in my bag, and on the Sunday morning I came down in them.&nbsp;
He met me in the garden.&nbsp; He was dressed in a frock coat and
a white waistcoat; and I noticed that he kept looking at me out
of the corner of his eye, and that he seemed to have a trouble on
his mind.&nbsp; The first breakfast bell rang, and then he said,
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got any proper clothes with you, have
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proper clothes!&rdquo; I exclaimed, stopping in some
alarm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, has anything given way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not that,&rdquo; he explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean
clothes to go to church in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Church,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re surely
not going to church a fine day like this?&nbsp; I made sure
you&rsquo;d be playing tennis, or going on the river.&nbsp; You
always used to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, nervously flicking a rose-bush
with a twig he had picked up.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, it
isn&rsquo;t ourselves exactly.&nbsp; Maud and I would rather like
to, but our cook, she&rsquo;s Scotch, and a little strict in her
notions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does she insist on your going to church every
Sunday morning?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;she thinks it strange
if we don&rsquo;t, and so we generally do, just in the
morning&mdash;and evening.&nbsp; And then in the afternoon a few
of the village girls drop in, and we have a little singing and
that sort of thing.&nbsp; I never like hurting anyone&rsquo;s
feelings if I can help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not say what I thought.&nbsp; Instead I said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got that tweed suit I wore yesterday.&nbsp; I
can put that on if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ceased flicking the rose-bush, and knitted his brows.&nbsp;
He seemed to be recalling it to his imagination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid it would shock her.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my fault, I
know,&rdquo; he added, remorsefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ought to have
told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then an idea came to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t
care to pretend you were ill, and stop in bed just for the
day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I explained that my conscience would not permit my being a
party to such deception</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must explain it to her.&nbsp; I think
I&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;ve lost your bag.&nbsp; I
shouldn&rsquo;t like her to think bad of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later on a fourteenth cousin died, leaving him a large
fortune.&nbsp; He purchased an estate in Yorkshire, and became a
&ldquo;county family,&rdquo; and then his real troubles
began.</p>
<p>From May to the middle of August, save for a little fly
fishing, which generally resulted in his getting his feet wet and
catching a cold, life was fairly peaceful; but from early autumn
to late spring he found the work decidedly trying.&nbsp; He was a
stout man, constitutionally nervous of fire-arms, and a
six-hours&rsquo; tramp with a heavy gun across ploughed fields,
in company with a crowd of careless persons who kept blazing away
within an inch of other people&rsquo;s noses, harassed and
exhausted him.&nbsp; He had to get out of bed at four on chilly
October mornings to go cub-hunting, and twice a week throughout
the winter&mdash;except when a blessed frost brought him a brief
respite&mdash;he had to ride to hounds.&nbsp; That he usually got
off with nothing more serious than mere bruises and slight
concussions of the spine, he probably owed to the fortunate
circumstances of his being little and fat.&nbsp; At stiff timber
he shut his eyes and rode hard; and ten yards from a river he
would begin to think about bridges.</p>
<p>Yet he never complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are a country gentleman,&rdquo; he would say,
&ldquo;you must behave as a country gentleman, and take the rough
with the smooth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As ill fate would have it a chance speculation doubled his
fortune, and it became necessary that he should go into
Parliament and start a yacht.&nbsp; Parliament made his head
ache, and the yacht made him sick.&nbsp; Notwithstanding, every
summer he would fill it with a lot of expensive people who bored
him, and sail away for a month&rsquo;s misery in the
Mediterranean.</p>
<p>During one cruise his guests built up a highly-interesting
gambling scandal.&nbsp; He himself was confined to his cabin at
the time, and knew nothing about it; but the Opposition papers,
getting hold of the story, referred casually to the yacht as a
&ldquo;floating hell,&rdquo; and <i>The Police News</i> awarded
his portrait the place of honour as the chief criminal of the
week.</p>
<p>Later on he got into a cultured set, ruled by a thick-lipped
undergraduate.&nbsp; His favourite literature had hitherto been
of the Corelli and <i>Tit-Bits</i> order, but now he read
Meredith and the yellow book, and tried to understand them; and
instead of the Gaiety, he subscribed to the Independent Theatre,
and fed &ldquo;his soul,&rdquo; on Dutch Shakespeares.&nbsp; What
he liked in art was a pretty girl by a cottage-door with an
eligible young man in the background, or a child and a dog doing
something funny.&nbsp; They told him these things were wrong and
made him buy &ldquo;Impressions&rdquo; that stirred his liver to
its deepest depths every time he looked at them&mdash;green cows
on red hills by pink moonlight, or scarlet-haired corpses with
three feet of neck.</p>
<p>He said meekly that such seemed to him unnatural, but they
answered that nature had nothing to do with the question; that
the artist saw things like that, and that whatever an artist
saw&mdash;no matter in what condition he may have been when he
saw it&mdash;that was art.</p>
<p>They took him to Wagner festivals and Burne-Jones&rsquo;s
private views.&nbsp; They read him all the minor poets.&nbsp;
They booked seats for him at all Ibsen&rsquo;s plays.&nbsp; They
introduced him into all the most soulful circles of artistic
society.&nbsp; His days were one long feast of other
people&rsquo;s enjoyments.</p>
<p>One morning I met him coming down the steps of the Arts
Club.&nbsp; He looked weary.&nbsp; He was just off to a private
view at the New Gallery.&nbsp; In the afternoon he had to attend
an amateur performance of &ldquo;The Cenci,&rdquo; given by the
Shelley Society.&nbsp; Then followed three literary and artistic
At Homes, a dinner with an Indian nabob who couldn&rsquo;t speak
a word of English, &ldquo;Tristam and Isolde&rdquo; at Covent
Garden Theatre, and a ball at Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s to wind up
the day.</p>
<p>I laid my hand upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me to Epping Forest,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a four-horse brake starts from Charing Cross
at eleven.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Saturday, and there&rsquo;s bound to
be a crowd down there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll play you a game of
skittles, and we will have a shy at the cocoa-nuts.&nbsp; You
used to be rather smart at cocoa-nuts.&nbsp; We can have lunch
there and be back at seven, dine at the Troc., spend the evening
at the Empire, and sup at the Savoy.&nbsp; What do you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood hesitating on the steps, a wistful look in his
eyes.</p>
<p>His brougham drew up against the curb, and he started as if
from a dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;what would
people say?&rdquo;&nbsp; And shaking me by the hand, he took his
seat, and the footman slammed the door upon him.</p>
<h2>A MAN OF HABIT</h2>
<p>There were three of us in the smoke-room of the
<i>Alexandra</i>&mdash;a very good friend of mine, myself, and,
in the opposite corner, a shy-looking, unobtrusive man, the
editor, as we subsequently learned, of a New York Sunday
paper.</p>
<p>My friend and I were discussing habits, good and bad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the first few months,&rdquo; said my friend,
&ldquo;it is no more effort for a man to be a saint than to be a
sinner; it becomes a mere matter of habit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;it is every whit
as easy to spring out of bed the instant you are called as to say
&lsquo;All Right,&rsquo; and turn over for just another five
minutes&rsquo; snooze, when you have got into the way of
it.&nbsp; It is no more trouble not to swear than to swear, if
you make a custom of it.&nbsp; Toast and water is as delicious as
champagne, when you have acquired the taste for it.&nbsp; Things
are also just as easy the other way about.&nbsp; It is a mere
question of making your choice and sticking to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He agreed with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now take these cigars of mine,&rdquo; he said, pushing
his open case towards me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I replied hurriedly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not smoking this passage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I
meant merely as an argument.&nbsp; Now one of these would make
you wretched for a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I admitted his premise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I, as
you know, smoke them all day long, and enjoy them.&nbsp;
Why?&nbsp; Because I have got into the habit.&nbsp; Years ago,
when I was a young man, I smoked expensive Havanas.&nbsp; I found
that I was ruining myself.&nbsp; It was absolutely necessary that
I should take a cheaper weed.&nbsp; I was living in Belgium at
the time, and a friend showed me these.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
what they are&mdash;probably cabbage leaves soaked in guano; they
tasted to me like that at first&mdash;but they were cheap.&nbsp;
Buying them by the five hundred, they cost me three a
penny.&nbsp; I determined to like them, and started with one a
day.&nbsp; It was terrible work, I admit, but as I said to
myself, nothing could be worse than the Havanas themselves had
been in the beginning.&nbsp; Smoking is an acquired taste, and it
must be as easy to learn to like one flavour as another.&nbsp; I
persevered and I conquered.&nbsp; Before the year was over I
could think of them without loathing, at the end of two I could
smoke them without positive discomfort.&nbsp; Now I prefer them
to any other brand on the market.&nbsp; Indeed, a good cigar
disagrees with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suggested it might have been less painful to have given up
smoking altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did think of it,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but a man
who doesn&rsquo;t smoke always seems to me bad company.&nbsp;
There is something very sociable about smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leant back and puffed great clouds into the air, filling
the small den with an odour suggestive of bilge water and
cemeteries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then again,&rdquo; he resumed after a pause,
&ldquo;take my claret.&nbsp; No, you don&rsquo;t like
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; (I had not spoken, but my face had evidently
betrayed me.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody does, at least no one I have
ever met.&nbsp; Three years ago, when I was living in
Hammersmith, we caught two burglars with it.&nbsp; They broke
open the sideboard, and swallowed five bottlefuls between
them.&nbsp; A policeman found them afterwards, sitting on a
doorstep a hundred yards off, the &lsquo;swag&rsquo; beside them
in a carpet bag.&nbsp; They were too ill to offer any resistance,
and went to the station like lambs, he promising to send the
doctor to them the moment they were safe in the cells.&nbsp; Ever
since then I have left out a decanterful upon the table every
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I like that claret, and it does me good.&nbsp; I
come in sometimes dead beat.&nbsp; I drink a couple of glasses,
and I&rsquo;m a new man.&nbsp; I took to it in the first instance
for the same reason that I took to the cigars&mdash;it was
cheap.&nbsp; I have it sent over direct from Geneva, and it costs
me six shillings a dozen.&nbsp; How they do it I don&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to know.&nbsp; As you may
remember, it&rsquo;s fairly heady and there&rsquo;s body in
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew one man,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;who had a
regular Mrs. Caudle of a wife.&nbsp; All day long she talked to
him, or at him, or of him, and at night he fell asleep to the
rising and falling rhythm of what she thought about him.&nbsp; At
last she died, and his friends congratulated him, telling him
that now he would enjoy peace.&nbsp; But it was the peace of the
desert, and the man did not enjoy it.&nbsp; For two-and-twenty
years her voice had filled the house, penetrated through the
conservatory, and floated in faint shrilly waves of sound round
the garden, and out into the road beyond.&nbsp; The silence now
pervading everywhere frightened and disturbed him.&nbsp; The
place was no longer home to him.&nbsp; He missed the breezy
morning insult, the long winter evening&rsquo;s reproaches beside
the flickering fire.&nbsp; At night he could not sleep.&nbsp; For
hours he would lie tossing restlessly, his ears aching for the
accustomed soothing flow of invective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he would cry bitterly to himself,
&lsquo;it is the old story, we never know the value of a thing
until we have lost it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He grew ill.&nbsp; The doctors dosed him with sleeping
draughts in vain.&nbsp; At last they told him bluntly that his
life depended upon his finding another wife, able and willing to
nag him to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were plenty of wives of the type he wanted in the
neighbourhood, but the unmarried women were, of necessity,
inexperienced, and his health was such that he could not afford
the time to train them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately, just as despair was about to take
possession of him, a man died in the next parish, literally
talked to death, the gossip said, by his wife.&nbsp; He obtained
an introduction, and called upon her the day after the
funeral.&nbsp; She was a cantankerous old woman, and the wooing
was a harassing affair, but his heart was in his work, and before
six months were gone he had won her for his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She proved, however, but a poor substitute.&nbsp; The
spirit was willing but the flesh was weak.&nbsp; She had neither
that command of language nor of wind that had distinguished her
rival.&nbsp; From his favourite seat at the bottom of the garden
he could not hear her at all, so he had his chair brought up into
the conservatory.&nbsp; It was all right for him there so long as
she continued to abuse him; but every now and again, just as he
was getting comfortably settled down with his pipe and his
newspaper, she would suddenly stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would drop his paper and sit listening, with a
troubled, anxious expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you there, dear?&rsquo; he would call out
after a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m here.&nbsp; Where do you think I
am you old fool?&rsquo; she would gasp back in an exhausted
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His face would brighten at the sound of her
words.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go on, dear,&rsquo; he would answer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m listening.&nbsp; I like to hear you
talk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the poor woman was utterly pumped out, and had not
so much as a snort left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he would shake his head sadly.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,
she hasn&rsquo;t poor dear Susan&rsquo;s flow,&rsquo; he would
say.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah! what a woman that was!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At night she would do her best, but it was a lame and
halting performance by comparison.&nbsp; After rating him for
little over three-quarters of an hour, she would sink back on the
pillow, and want to go to sleep.&nbsp; But he would shake her
gently by the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, dear,&rsquo; he would say, &lsquo;you were
speaking about Jane, and the way I kept looking at her during
lunch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s extraordinary,&rdquo; concluded my friend,
lighting a fresh cigar, &ldquo;what creatures of habit we
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew a man who
told tall stories till when he told a true one nobody believed
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that was a very sad case,&rdquo; said my
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of habit,&rdquo; said the unobtrusive man in
the corner, &ldquo;I can tell you a true story that I&rsquo;ll
bet my bottom dollar you won&rsquo;t believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t got a bottom dollar, but I&rsquo;ll bet
you half a sovereign I do,&rdquo; replied my friend, who was of a
sporting turn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who shall be judge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your word for it,&rdquo; said the
unobtrusive man, and started straight away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a Jefferson man, this man I&rsquo;m going to
tell you of,&rdquo; he begun.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was born in the
town, and for forty-seven years he never slept a night outside
it.&nbsp; He was a most respectable man&mdash;a drysalter from
nine to four, and a Presbyterian in his leisure moments.&nbsp; He
said that a good life merely meant good habits.&nbsp; He rose at
seven, had family prayer at seven-thirty, breakfasted at eight,
got to his business at nine, had his horse brought round to the
office at four, and rode for an hour, reached home at five, had a
bath and a cup of tea, played with and read to the children (he
was a domesticated man) till half-past six, dressed and dined at
seven, went round to the club and played whist till quarter after
ten, home again to evening prayer at ten-thirty, and bed at
eleven.&nbsp; For five-and-twenty years he lived that life with
never a variation.&nbsp; It worked into his system and became
mechanical.&nbsp; The church clocks were set by him.&nbsp; He was
used by the local astronomers to check the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day a distant connection of his in London, an East
Indian Merchant and an ex-Lord Mayor died, leaving him sole
legatee and executor.&nbsp; The business was a complicated one
and needed management.&nbsp; He determined to leave his son by
his first wife, now a young man of twenty-four, in charge at
Jefferson, and to establish himself with his second family in
England, and look after the East Indian business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He set out from Jefferson City on October the fourth,
and arrived in London on the seventeenth.&nbsp; He had been ill
during the whole of the voyage, and he reached the furnished
house he had hired in Bayswater somewhat of a wreck.&nbsp; A
couple of days in bed, however, pulled him round, and on the
Wednesday evening he announced his intention of going into the
City the next day to see to his affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the Thursday morning he awoke at one
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; His wife told him she had not disturbed him,
thinking the sleep would do him good.&nbsp; He admitted that
perhaps it had.&nbsp; Anyhow, he felt very well, and he got up
and dressed himself.&nbsp; He said he did not like the idea of
beginning his first day by neglecting a religious duty, and his
wife agreeing with him, they assembled the servants and the
children in the dining-room, and had family prayer at half-past
one.&nbsp; After which he breakfasted and set off, reaching the
City about three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His reputation for punctuality had preceded him, and
surprise was everywhere expressed at his late arrival.&nbsp; He
explained the circumstances, however, and made his appointments
for the following day to commence from nine-thirty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He remained at the office until late, and then went
home.&nbsp; For dinner, usually the chief meal of the day, he
could manage to eat only a biscuit and some fruit.&nbsp; He
attributed his loss of appetite to want of his customary
ride.&nbsp; He was strangely unsettled all the evening.&nbsp; He
said he supposed he missed his game of whist, and determined to
look about him without loss of time for some quiet, respectable
club.&nbsp; At eleven he retired with his wife to bed, but could
not sleep.&nbsp; He tossed and turned, and turned and tossed, but
grew only more and more wakeful and energetic.&nbsp; A little
after midnight an overpowering desire seized him to go and wish
the children good-night.&nbsp; He slipped on a dressing-gown and
stole into the nursery.&nbsp; He did not intend it, but the
opening of the door awoke them, and he was glad.&nbsp; He wrapped
them up in the quilt, and, sitting on the edge of the bed, told
them moral stories till one o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he kissed them, bidding them be good and go to
sleep; and finding himself painfully hungry, crept downstairs,
where in the back kitchen he made a hearty meal off cold game pie
and cucumber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He retired to bed feeling more peaceful, yet still
could not sleep, so lay thinking about his business affairs till
five, when he dropped off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At one o&rsquo;clock to the minute he awoke.&nbsp; His
wife told him she had made every endeavour to rouse him, but in
vain.&nbsp; The man was vexed and irritated.&nbsp; If he had not
been a very good man indeed, I believe he would have sworn.&nbsp;
The same programme was repeated as on the Thursday, and again he
reached the City at three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This state of things went on for a month.&nbsp; The man
fought against himself, but was unable to alter himself.&nbsp;
Every morning, or rather every afternoon at one he awoke.&nbsp;
Every night at one he crept down into the kitchen and foraged for
food.&nbsp; Every morning at five he fell asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could not understand it, nobody could understand
it.&nbsp; The doctor treated him for water on the brain, hypnotic
irresponsibility and hereditary lunacy.&nbsp; Meanwhile his
business suffered, and his health grew worse.&nbsp; He seemed to
be living upside down.&nbsp; His days seemed to have neither
beginning nor end, but to be all middle.&nbsp; There was no time
for exercise or recreation.&nbsp; When he began to feel cheerful
and sociable everybody else was asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day by chance the explanation came.&nbsp; His
eldest daughter was preparing her home studies after dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What time is it now in New York?&rsquo; she
asked, looking up from her geography book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;New York,&rsquo; said her father, glancing at
his watch, &lsquo;let me see.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just ten now, and
there&rsquo;s a little over four and a half hours&rsquo;
difference.&nbsp; Oh, about half-past five in the
afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then in Jefferson,&rsquo; said the mother,
&lsquo;it would be still earlier, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied the girl, examining the map,
&lsquo;Jefferson is nearly two degrees further west.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Two degrees,&rsquo; mused the father, &lsquo;and
there&rsquo;s forty minutes to a degree.&nbsp; That would make it
now, at the present moment in Jefferson&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He leaped to his feet with a cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rsquo; he shouted, &lsquo;I
see it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;See what?&rsquo; asked his wife, alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s four o&rsquo;clock in Jefferson,
and just time for my ride.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m
wanting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There could be no doubt about it.&nbsp; For
five-and-twenty years he had lived by clockwork.&nbsp; But it was
by Jefferson clockwork, not London clockwork.&nbsp; He had
changed his longitude, but not himself.&nbsp; The habits of a
quarter of a century were not to be shifted at the bidding of the
sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He examined the problem in all its bearings, and
decided that the only solution was for him to return to the order
of his old life.&nbsp; He saw the difficulties in his way, but
they were less than those he was at present encountering.&nbsp;
He was too formed by habit to adapt himself to
circumstances.&nbsp; Circumstances must adapt themselves to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He fixed his office hours from three till ten, leaving
himself at half-past nine.&nbsp; At ten he mounted his horse and
went for a canter in the Row, and on very dark nights he carried
a lantern.&nbsp; News of it got abroad, and crowds would assemble
to see him ride past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He dined at one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and
afterwards strolled down to his club.&nbsp; He had tried to
discover a quiet, respectable club where the members were willing
to play whist till four in the morning, but failing, had been
compelled to join a small Soho gambling-hell, where they taught
him poker.&nbsp; The place was occasionally raided by the police,
but thanks to his respectable appearance, he generally managed to
escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At half-past four he returned home, and woke up the
family for evening prayers.&nbsp; At five he went to bed and
slept like a top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The City chaffed him, and Bayswater shook its head over
him, but that he did not mind.&nbsp; The only thing that really
troubled him was loss of spiritual communion.&nbsp; At five
o&rsquo;clock on Sunday afternoons he felt he wanted chapel, but
had to do without it.&nbsp; At seven he ate his simple mid-day
meal.&nbsp; At eleven he had tea and muffins, and at midnight he
began to crave again for hymns and sermons.&nbsp; At three he had
a bread-and-cheese supper, and retired early at four a.m.,
feeling sad and unsatisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was essentially a man of habit.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The unobtrusive stranger ceased, and we sat gazing in silence
at the ceiling.</p>
<p>At length my friend rose, and taking half-a-sovereign from his
pocket, laid it upon the table, and linking his arm in mine went
out with me upon the deck.</p>
<h2>THE ABSENT-MINDED MAN</h2>
<p>You ask him to dine with you on Thursday to meet a few people
who are anxious to know him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t make a muddle of it,&rdquo; you say,
recollectful of former mishaps, &ldquo;and come on the
Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughs good-naturedly as he hunts through the room for his
diary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t be able to come Wednesday,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;shall be at the Mansion House, sketching dresses, and on
Friday I start for Scotland, so as to be at the opening of the
Exhibition on Saturday.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s bound to be all right
this time.&nbsp; Where the deuce is that diary!&nbsp; Never mind,
I&rsquo;ll make a note of it on this&mdash;you can see me do
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You stand over him while he writes the appointment down on a
sheet of foolscap, and watch him pin it up over his desk.&nbsp;
Then you come away contented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do hope he&rsquo;ll turn up,&rdquo; you say to your
wife on the Thursday evening, while dressing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you made it clear to him?&rdquo; she
replies, suspiciously, and you instinctively feel that whatever
happens she is going to blame you for it.</p>
<p>Eight o&rsquo;clock arrives, and with it the other
guests.&nbsp; At half-past eight your wife is beckoned
mysteriously out of the room, where the parlour-maid informs her
that the cook has expressed a determination, in case of further
delay, to wash her hands, figuratively speaking, of the whole
affair.</p>
<p>Your wife, returning, suggests that if the dinner is to be
eaten at all it had better be begun.&nbsp; She evidently
considers that in pretending to expect him you have been merely
playing a part, and that it would have been manlier and more
straightforward for you to have admitted at the beginning that
you had forgotten to invite him.</p>
<p>During the soup and the fish you recount anecdotes of his
unpunctuality.&nbsp; By the time the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> arrives
the empty chair has begun to cast a gloom over the dinner, and
with the joint the conversation drifts into talk about dead
relatives.</p>
<p>On Friday, at a quarter past eight, he dashes to the door and
rings violently.&nbsp; Hearing his voice in the hall, you go to
meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry I&rsquo;m late,&rdquo; he sings out
cheerily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fool of a cabman took me to Alfred Place
instead of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want now you are come?&rdquo; you
interrupt, feeling anything but genially inclined towards
him.&nbsp; He is an old friend, so you can be rude to him.</p>
<p>He laughs, and slaps you on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my dinner, my dear boy, I&rsquo;m
starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; you grunt in reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, you
go and get it somewhere else, then.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not going
to have it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil do you mean?&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You asked me to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did nothing of the kind,&rdquo; you tell him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I asked you to dinner on Thursday, not on
Friday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stares at you incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did I get Friday fixed in my mind?&rdquo;
inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because yours is the sort of mind that would get Friday
firmly fixed into it, when Thursday was the day,&rdquo; you
explain.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought you had to be off to Edinburgh
to-night,&rdquo; you add.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;so I
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And without another word he dashes out, and you hear him
rushing down the road, shouting for the cab he has just
dismissed.</p>
<p>As you return to your study you reflect that he will have to
travel all the way to Scotland in evening dress, and will have to
send out the hotel porter in the morning to buy him a suit of
ready-made clothes, and are glad.</p>
<p>Matters work out still more awkwardly when it is he who is the
host.&nbsp; I remember being with him on his house-boat one
day.&nbsp; It was a little after twelve, and we were sitting on
the edge of the boat, dangling our feet in the river&mdash;the
spot was a lonely one, half-way between Wallingford and
Day&rsquo;s Lock.&nbsp; Suddenly round the bend appeared two
skiffs, each one containing six elaborately-dressed
persons.&nbsp; As soon as they caught sight of us they began
waving handkerchiefs and parasols.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s some people
hailing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they all do that about here,&rdquo; he answered,
without looking up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some beanfeast from Abingdon, I
expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boats draw nearer.&nbsp; When about two hundred yards off
an elderly gentleman raised himself up in the prow of the leading
one and shouted to us.</p>
<p>McQuae heard his voice, and gave a start that all but pitched
him into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten
all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s the Palmers and the Grahams and the
Hendersons.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve asked them all over to lunch, and
there&rsquo;s not a blessed thing on board but two mutton chops
and a pound of potatoes, and I&rsquo;ve given the boy a
holiday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another day I was lunching with him at the Junior Hogarth,
when a man named Hallyard, a mutual friend, strolled across to
us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you fellows going to do this afternoon?&rdquo;
he asked, seating himself the opposite side of the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stop here and write letters,&rdquo;
I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me if you want something to do,&rdquo; said
McQuae.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to drive Leena down to
Richmond.&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Leena&rdquo; was the young lady he
recollected being engaged to.&nbsp; It transpired afterwards that
he was engaged to three girls at the time.&nbsp; The other two he
had forgotten all about.)&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a roomy seat at
the back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; said Hallyard, and they went away
together in a hansom.</p>
<p>An hour and a half later Hallyard walked into the smoking-room
looking depressed and worn, and flung himself into a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were going to Richmond with
McQuae,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had an accident?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was decidedly curt in his replies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cart upset?&rdquo; I continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His grammar and his nerves seemed thoroughly shaken.</p>
<p>I waited for an explanation, and after a while he gave it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got to Putney,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with just an
occasional run into a tram-car, and were going up the hill, when
suddenly he turned a corner.&nbsp; You know his style at a
corner&mdash;over the curb, across the road, and into the
opposite lamp-post.&nbsp; Of course, as a rule one is prepared
for it, but I never reckoned on his turning up there, and the
first thing I recollect is finding myself sitting in the middle
of the street with a dozen fools grinning at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes a man a few minutes in such a case to think
where he is and what has happened, and when I got up they were
some distance away.&nbsp; I ran after them for a quarter of a
mile, shouting at the top of my voice, and accompanied by a mob
of boys, all yelling like hell on a Bank Holiday.&nbsp; But one
might as well have tried to hail the dead, so I took the
&rsquo;bus back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might have guessed what had happened,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;by the shifting of the cart, if they&rsquo;d had
any sense.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not a light-weight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He complained of soreness, and said he would go home.&nbsp; I
suggested a cab, but he replied that he would rather walk.</p>
<p>I met McQuae in the evening at the St. James&rsquo;s
Theatre.&nbsp; It was a first night, and he was taking sketches
for <i>The Graphic</i>.&nbsp; The moment he saw me he made his
way across to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very man I wanted to see,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did I take Hallyard with me in the cart to Richmond this
afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Leena says,&rdquo; he answered, greatly bewildered,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll swear he wasn&rsquo;t there when we got to
the Queen&rsquo;s Hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you dropped
him at Putney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dropped him at Putney!&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no recollection of doing so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You ask him
about it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s full of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody said he never would get married; that it was absurd
to suppose he ever would remember the day, the church, and the
girl, all in one morning; that if he did get as far as the altar
he would forget what he had come for, and would give the bride
away to his own best man.&nbsp; Hallyard had an idea that he was
already married, but that the fact had slipped his memory.&nbsp;
I myself felt sure that if he did marry he would forget all about
it the next day.</p>
<p>But everybody was wrong.&nbsp; By some miraculous means the
ceremony got itself accomplished, so that if Hallyard&rsquo;s
idea be correct (as to which there is every possibility), there
will be trouble.&nbsp; As for my own fears, I dismissed them the
moment I saw the lady.&nbsp; She was a charming, cheerful little
woman, but did not look the type that would let him forget all
about it.</p>
<p>I had not seen him since his marriage, which had happened in
the spring.&nbsp; Working my way back from Scotland by easy
stages, I stopped for a few days at Scarboro&rsquo;.&nbsp; After
<i>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> I put on my mackintosh, and went
out for a walk.&nbsp; It was raining hard, but after a month in
Scotland one does not notice English weather, and I wanted some
air.&nbsp; Struggling along the dark beach with my head against
the wind, I stumbled over a crouching figure, seeking to shelter
itself a little from the storm under the lee of the Spa wall.</p>
<p>I expected it to swear at me, but it seemed too
broken-spirited to mind anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did
not see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the sound of my voice it started to its feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, old man?&rdquo; it cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;McQuae!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was never so glad to
see a man in all my life before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he nearly shook my hand off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what in thunder!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;are you
doing here?&nbsp; Why, you&rsquo;re drenched to the
skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was dressed in flannels and a tennis-coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never thought
it would rain.&nbsp; It was a lovely morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I began to fear he had overworked himself into a brain
fever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go home?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know where I live.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve forgotten the
address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take me
somewhere, and give me something to eat.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
literally starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any money?&rdquo; I asked him, as we
turned towards the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a sou,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;We got in
here from York, the wife and I, about eleven.&nbsp; We left our
things at the station, and started to hunt for apartments.&nbsp;
As soon as we were fixed, I changed my clothes and came out for a
walk, telling Maud I should be back at one to lunch.&nbsp; Like a
fool, I never took the address, and never noticed the way I was
going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awful business,&rdquo; he
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I&rsquo;m ever
going to find her.&nbsp; I hoped she might stroll down to the Spa
in the evening, and I&rsquo;ve been hanging about the gates ever
since six.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t the threepence to go
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But have you no notion of the sort of street or the
kind of house it was?&rdquo; I enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a ghost,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I left it
all to Maud, and didn&rsquo;t trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you tried any of the lodging-houses?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tried!&rdquo; he exclaimed bitterly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been knocking at doors, and asking if Mrs.
McQuae lives there steadily all the afternoon, and they slam the
door in my face, mostly without answering.&nbsp; I told a
policeman&mdash;I thought perhaps he might suggest
something&mdash;but the idiot only burst out laughing, and that
made me so mad that I gave him a black eye, and had to cut.&nbsp;
I expect they&rsquo;re on the lookout for me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went into a restaurant,&rdquo; he continued gloomily,
&ldquo;and tried to get them to trust me for a steak.&nbsp; But
the proprietress said she&rsquo;d heard that tale before, and
ordered me out before all the other customers.&nbsp; I think
I&rsquo;d have drowned myself if you hadn&rsquo;t turned
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a change of clothes and some supper, he discussed the
case more calmly, but it was really a serious affair.&nbsp; They
had shut up their flat, and his wife&rsquo;s relatives were
travelling abroad.&nbsp; There was no one to whom he could send a
letter to be forwarded; there was no one with whom she would be
likely to communicate.&nbsp; Their chance of meeting again in
this world appeared remote.</p>
<p>Nor did it seem to me&mdash;fond as he was of his wife, and
anxious as he undoubtedly was to recover her&mdash;that he looked
forward to the actual meeting, should it ever arrive, with any
too pleasurable anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will think it strange,&rdquo; he murmured
reflectively, sitting on the edge of the bed, and thoughtfully
pulling off his socks.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is sure to think it
strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following day, which was Wednesday, we went to a
solicitor, and laid the case before him, and he instituted
inquiries among all the lodging-house keepers in Scarborough,
with the result that on Thursday afternoon McQuae was restored
(after the manner of an Adelphi hero in the last act) to his home
and wife.</p>
<p>I asked him next time I met him what she had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, much what I expected,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>But he never told me what he had expected.</p>
<h2>A CHARMING WOMAN</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Not <i>the Mr. ---</i>, <i>really</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her deep brown eyes there lurked pleased surprise,
struggling with wonder.&nbsp; She looked from myself to the
friend who introduced us with a bewitching smile of incredulity,
tempered by hope.</p>
<p>He assured her, adding laughingly, &ldquo;The only genuine and
original,&rdquo; and left us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always thought of you as a staid,
middle-aged man,&rdquo; she said, with a delicious little laugh,
then added in low soft tones, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so very pleased to
meet you, really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were conventional, but her voice crept round one
like a warm caress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and talk to me,&rdquo; she said, seating herself
upon a small settee, and making room for me.</p>
<p>I sat down awkwardly beside her, my head buzzing just a
little, as with one glass too many of champagne.&nbsp; I was in
my literary childhood.&nbsp; One small book and a few essays and
criticisms, scattered through various obscure periodicals had
been as yet my only contributions to current literature.&nbsp;
The sudden discovery that I was the Mr. Anybody, and that
charming women thought of me, and were delighted to meet me, was
a brain-disturbing thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was really you who wrote that clever
book?&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and all those brilliant
things, in the magazines and journals.&nbsp; Oh, it must be
delightful to be clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave breath to a little sigh of vain regret that went to
my heart.&nbsp; To console her I commenced a laboured compliment,
but she stopped me with her fan.&nbsp; On after reflection I was
glad she had&mdash;it would have been one of those things better
expressed otherwise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you are going to say,&rdquo; she laughed,
&ldquo;but don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Besides, from you I should not know
quite how to take it.&nbsp; You can be so satirical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to look as though I could be, but in her case would
not.</p>
<p>She let her ungloved hand rest for an instant upon mine.&nbsp;
Had she left it there for two, I should have gone down on my
knees before her, or have stood on my head at her feet&mdash;have
made a fool of myself in some way or another before the whole
room full.&nbsp; She timed it to a nicety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want <i>you</i> to pay me
compliments,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want us to be
friends.&nbsp; Of course, in years, I&rsquo;m old enough to be
your mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; (By the register I should say she might
have been thirty-two, but looked twenty-six.&nbsp; I was
twenty-three, and I fear foolish for my age.)&nbsp; &ldquo;But
you know the world, and you&rsquo;re so different to the other
people one meets.&nbsp; Society is so hollow and artificial;
don&rsquo;t you find it so?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know how I long
sometimes to get away from it, to know someone to whom I could
show my real self, who would understand me.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
come and see me sometimes&mdash;I&rsquo;m always at home on
Wednesdays&mdash;and let me talk to you, won&rsquo;t you, and you
must tell me all your clever thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It occurred to me that, maybe, she would like to hear a few of
them there and then, but before I had got well started a hollow
Society man came up and suggested supper, and she was compelled
to leave me.&nbsp; As she disappeared, however, in the throng,
she looked back over her shoulder with a glance half pathetic,
half comic, that I understood.&nbsp; It said, &ldquo;Pity me,
I&rsquo;ve got to be bored by this vapid, shallow
creature,&rdquo; and I did.</p>
<p>I sought her through all the rooms before I went.&nbsp; I
wished to assure her of my sympathy and support.&nbsp; I learned,
however, from the butler that she had left early, in company with
the hollow Society man.</p>
<p>A fortnight later I ran against a young literary friend in
Regent Street, and we lunched together at the Monico.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met such a charming woman last night,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;a Mrs. Clifton Courtenay, a delightful woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do <i>you</i> know her?&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re very old friends.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s always
wanting me to go and see her.&nbsp; I really must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know <i>you</i> knew her,&rdquo; he
answered.&nbsp; Somehow, the fact of my knowing her seemed to
lessen her importance in his eyes.&nbsp; But soon he recovered
his enthusiasm for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wonderfully clever woman,&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I disappointed her a little
though.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said this, however, with a laugh that
contradicted his words.&nbsp; &ldquo;She would not believe I was
<i>the</i> Mr. Smith.&nbsp; She imagined from my book that I was
quite an old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could see nothing in my friend&rsquo;s book myself to
suggest that the author was, of necessity, anything over
eighteen.&nbsp; The mistake appeared to me to display want of
acumen, but it had evidently pleased him greatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt quite sorry for her,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;chained to that bloodless, artificial society in which she
lives.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t tell,&rsquo; she said to me,
&lsquo;how I long to meet someone to whom I could show my real
self&mdash;who would understand me.&rsquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going
to see her on Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went with him.&nbsp; My conversation with her was not as
confidential as I had anticipated, owing to there being some
eighty other people present in a room intended for the
accommodation of eight; but after surging round for an hour in
hot and aimless misery&mdash;as very young men at such gatherings
do, knowing as a rule only the man who has brought them, and
being unable to find him&mdash;I contrived to get a few words
with her.</p>
<p>She greeted me with a smile, in the light of which I at once
forgot my past discomfort, and let her fingers rest, with
delicious pressure, for a moment upon mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How good of you to keep your promise,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;These people have been tiring me so.&nbsp; Sit
here, and tell me all you have been doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She listened for about ten seconds, and then interrupted me
with&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that clever friend of yours that you came
with.&nbsp; I met him at dear Lady Lennon&rsquo;s last
week.&nbsp; Has <i>he</i> written anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I explained to her that he had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it?&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I get
so little time for reading, and then I only care to read the
books that help me,&rdquo; and she gave me a grateful look more
eloquent than words.</p>
<p>I described the work to her, and wishing to do my friend
justice I even recited a few of the passages upon which, as I
knew, he especially prided himself.</p>
<p>One sentence in particular seemed to lay hold of her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A good woman&rsquo;s arms round a man&rsquo;s neck is a
lifebelt thrown out to him from heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How beautiful!&rdquo; she murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say it
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said it again, and she repeated it after me.</p>
<p>Then a noisy old lady swooped down upon her, and I drifted
away into a corner, where I tried to look as if I were enjoying
myself, and failed.</p>
<p>Later on, feeling it time to go, I sought my friend, and found
him talking to her in a corner.&nbsp; I approached and
waited.&nbsp; They were discussing the latest east-end
murder.&nbsp; A drunken woman had been killed by her husband, a
hard-working artizan, who had been maddened by the ruin of his
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she was saying, &ldquo;what power a woman
has to drag a man down or lift him up.&nbsp; I never read a case
in which a woman is concerned without thinking of those beautiful
lines of yours: &lsquo;A good woman&rsquo;s arms round a
man&rsquo;s neck is a lifebelt thrown out to him from
heaven.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Opinions differed concerning her religion and politics.&nbsp;
Said the Low Church parson: &ldquo;An earnest Christian woman,
sir, of that unostentatious type that has always been the bulwark
of our Church.&nbsp; I am proud to know that woman, and I am
proud to think that poor words of mine have been the humble
instrument to wean that true woman&rsquo;s heart from the
frivolities of fashion, and to fix her thoughts upon higher
things.&nbsp; A good Churchwoman, sir, a good Churchwoman, in the
best sense of the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said the pale aristocratic-looking young Abb&eacute; to the
Comtesse, the light of old-world enthusiasm shining from his
deep-set eyes: &ldquo;I have great hopes for our dear
friend.&nbsp; She finds it hard to sever the ties of time and
love.&nbsp; We are all weak, but her heart turns towards our
mother Church as a child, though suckled among strangers, yearns
after many years for the bosom that has borne it.&nbsp; We have
spoken, and I, even I, may be the voice in the wilderness leading
the lost sheep back to the fold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Sir Harry Bennett, the great Theosophist lecturer,
writing to a friend: &ldquo;A singularly gifted woman, and a
woman evidently thirsting for the truth.&nbsp; A woman capable of
willing her own life.&nbsp; A woman not afraid of thought and
reason, a lover of wisdom.&nbsp; I have talked much with her at
one time or another, and I have found her grasp my meaning with a
quickness of perception quite unusual in my experience; and the
arguments I have let fall, I am convinced, have borne excellent
fruit.&nbsp; I look forward to her becoming, at no very distant
date, a valued member of our little band.&nbsp; Indeed, without
betraying confidence, I may almost say I regard her conversion as
an accomplished fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Maxim always spoke of her as &ldquo;a fair pillar of
the State.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the enemy in our midst,&rdquo; said the florid old
soldier, &ldquo;it behoves every true man&mdash;aye, and every
true woman&mdash;to rally to the defence of the country; and all
honour, say I, to noble ladies such as Mrs. Clifton Courtenay,
who, laying aside their natural shrinking from publicity, come
forward in such a crisis as the present to combat the forces of
disorder and disloyalty now rampant in the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; some listener would suggest, &ldquo;I
gathered from young Jocelyn that Mrs. Clifton Courtenay held
somewhat advanced views on social and political
questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jocelyn,&rdquo; the Colonel would reply with scorn;
&ldquo;pah!&nbsp; There may have been a short space of time
during which the fellow&rsquo;s long hair and windy rhetoric
impressed her.&nbsp; But I flatter myself I&rsquo;ve put
<i>my</i> spoke in Mr. Jocelyn&rsquo;s wheel.&nbsp; Why, damme,
sir, she&rsquo;s consented to stand for Grand Dame of the
Bermondsey Branch of the Primrose League next year.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s Jocelyn to say to that, the scoundrel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Jocelyn said was:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the woman is weak.&nbsp; But I do not blame her;
I pity her.&nbsp; When the time comes, as soon it will, when
woman is no longer a puppet, dancing to the threads held by some
brainless man&mdash;when a woman is not threatened with social
ostracism for daring to follow her own conscience instead of that
of her nearest male relative&mdash;then will be the time to judge
her.&nbsp; It is not for me to betray the confidence reposed in
me by a suffering woman, but you can tell that interesting old
fossil, Colonel Maxim, that he and the other old women of the
Bermondsey Branch of the Primrose League may elect Mrs. Clifton
Courtenay for their President, and make the most of it; they have
only got the outside of the woman.&nbsp; Her heart is beating
time to the tramp of an onward-marching people; her soul&rsquo;s
eyes are straining for the glory of a coming dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they all agreed she was a charming woman.</p>
<h2>WHIBLEY&rsquo;S SPIRIT</h2>
<p>I never met it myself, but I knew Whibley very well indeed, so
that I came to hear a goodish deal about it.</p>
<p>It appeared to be devoted to Whibley, and Whibley was
extremely fond of it.&nbsp; Personally I am not interested in
spirits, and no spirit has ever interested itself in me.&nbsp;
But I have friends whom they patronise, and my mind is quite open
on the subject.&nbsp; Of Whibley&rsquo;s Spirit I wish to speak
with every possible respect.&nbsp; It was, I am willing to admit,
as hard-working and conscientious a spirit as any one could wish
to live with.&nbsp; The only thing I have to say against it is
that it had no sense.</p>
<p>It came with a carved cabinet that Whibley had purchased in
Wardour Street for old oak, but which, as a matter of fact, was
chestnut wood, manufactured in Germany, and at first was harmless
enough, saying nothing but &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; or
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; and that only when spoken to.</p>
<p>Whibley would amuse himself of an evening asking it questions,
being careful to choose tolerably simple themes, such as,
&ldquo;Are you there?&rdquo; (to which the Spirit would sometimes
answer &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; and sometimes &ldquo;No!&rdquo;)&nbsp;
&ldquo;Can you hear me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you
happy?&rdquo;&mdash;and so on.&nbsp; The Spirit made the cabinet
crack&mdash;three times for &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and twice for
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now and then it would reply both
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; and &ldquo;No!&rdquo; to the same question,
which Whibley attributed to over-scrupulousness.&nbsp; When
nobody asked it anything it would talk to itself, repeating
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; over and over again in
an aimless, lonesome sort of a way that made you feel sorry for
it.</p>
<p>After a while Whibley bought a table, and encouraged it to
launch out into more active conversation.&nbsp; To please
Whibley, I assisted at some of the earlier s&eacute;ances, but
during my presence it invariably maintained a reticence bordering
on positive dulness.&nbsp; I gathered from Whibley that it
disliked me, thinking that I was unsympathetic.&nbsp; The
complaint was unjust; I was not unsympathetic, at least not at
the commencement.&nbsp; I came to hear it talk, and I wanted to
hear it talk; I would have listened to it by the hour.&nbsp; What
tired me was its slowness in starting, and its foolishness when
it had started, in using long words that it did not know how to
spell.&nbsp; I remember on one occasion, Whibley, Jobstock
(Whibley&rsquo;s partner), and myself, sitting for two hours,
trying to understand what the thing meant by
&ldquo;H-e-s-t-u-r-n-e-m-y-s-f-e-a-r.&rdquo;&nbsp; It used no
stops whatever.&nbsp; It never so much as hinted where one
sentence ended and another began.&nbsp; It never even told us
when it came to a proper name.&nbsp; Its idea of an
evening&rsquo;s conversation was to plump down a hundred or so
vowels and consonants in front of you and leave you to make
whatever sense out of them you could.</p>
<p>We fancied at first it was talking about somebody named Hester
(it had spelt Hester with a &ldquo;u&rdquo; before we allowed a
margin for spelling), and we tried to work the sentence out on
that basis, &ldquo;Hester enemies fear,&rdquo; we thought it
might be.&nbsp; Whibley had a niece named Hester, and we decided
the warning had reference to her.&nbsp; But whether she was our
enemy, and we were to fear her, or whether we had to fear her
enemies (and, if so, who were they?), or whether it was our
enemies who were to be frightened by Hester, or her enemies, or
enemies generally, still remained doubtful.&nbsp; We asked the
table if it meant the first suggestion, and it said
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; We asked what it did mean, and it said
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This answer annoyed me, but Whibley explained that the Spirit
was angry with us for our stupidity (which seemed quaint).&nbsp;
He informed us that it always said first &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and
then &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; when it was angry, and as it was his
Spirit, and we were in his house, we kept our feelings to
ourselves and started afresh.</p>
<p>This time we abandoned the &ldquo;Hestur&rdquo; theory
altogether.&nbsp; Jobstock suggested &ldquo;Haste&rdquo; for the
first word, and, thought the Spirit might have gone on
phonetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haste! you are here, Miss Sfear!&rdquo; was what he
made of it.</p>
<p>Whibley asked him sarcastically if he&rsquo;d kindly explain
what that meant.</p>
<p>I think Jobstock was getting irritable.&nbsp; We had been
sitting cramped up round a wretched little one-legged table all
the evening, and this was almost the first bit of gossip we had
got out of it.&nbsp; To further excuse him, it should also be
explained that the gas had been put out by Whibley, and that the
fire had gone out of its own accord.&nbsp; He replied that it was
hard labour enough to find out what the thing said without having
to make sense of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t spell,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and
it&rsquo;s got a nasty, sulky temper.&nbsp; If it was my spirit
I&rsquo;d hire another spirit to kick it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whibley was one of the mildest little men I ever knew, but
chaff or abuse of his Spirit roused the devil in him, and I
feared we were going to have a scene.&nbsp; Fortunately, I was
able to get his mind back to the consideration of
&ldquo;Hesturnemysfear&rdquo; before anything worse happened than
a few muttered remarks about the laughter of fools, and want of
reverence for sacred subjects being the sign of a shallow
mind.</p>
<p>We tried &ldquo;He&rsquo;s stern,&rdquo; and &ldquo;His
turn,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;fear of Hesturnemy,&rdquo; and tried
to think who &ldquo;Hesturnemy&rdquo; might be.&nbsp; Three times
we went over the whole thing again from the beginning, which
meant six hundred and six tiltings of the table, and then
suddenly the explanation struck me&mdash;&ldquo;Eastern
Hemisphere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whibley had asked it for any information it might possess
concerning his wife&rsquo;s uncle, from whom he had not heard for
months, and that apparently was its idea of an address.</p>
<p>The fame of Whibley&rsquo;s Spirit became noised abroad, with
the result that Whibley was able to command the willing service
of more congenial assistants, and Jobstock and myself were
dismissed.&nbsp; But we bore no malice.</p>
<p>Under these more favourable conditions the Spirit plucked up
wonderfully, and talked everybody&rsquo;s head off.&nbsp; It
could never have been a cheerful companion, however, for its
conversation was chiefly confined to warnings and
prognostications of evil.&nbsp; About once a fortnight Whibley
would drop round on me, in a friendly way, to tell me that I was
to beware of a man who lived in a street beginning with a
&ldquo;C,&rdquo; or to inform me that if I would go to a town on
the coast where there were three churches I should meet someone
who would do me an irreparable injury, and, that I did not rush
off then and there in search of that town he regarded as flying
in the face of Providence.</p>
<p>In its passion for poking its ghostly nose into other
people&rsquo;s affairs it reminded me of my earthly friend
Poppleton.&nbsp; Nothing pleased it better than being appealed to
for aid and advice, and Whibley, who was a perfect slave to it,
would hunt half over the parish for people in trouble and bring
them to it.</p>
<p>It would direct ladies, eager for divorce court evidence, to
go to the third house from the corner of the fifth street, past
such and such a church or public-house (it never would give a
plain, straightforward address), and ring the bottom bell but one
twice.&nbsp; They would thank it effusively, and next morning
would start to find the fifth street past the church, and would
ring the bottom bell but one of the third house from the corner
twice, and a man in his shirt sleeves would come to the door and
ask them what they wanted.</p>
<p>They could not tell what they wanted, they did not know
themselves, and the man would use bad language, and slam the door
in their faces.</p>
<p>Then they would think that perhaps the Spirit meant the fifth
street the other way, or the third house from the opposite
corner, and would try again, with still more unpleasant
results.</p>
<p>One July I met Whibley, mooning disconsolately along Princes
Street, Edinburgh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;what are you doing
here?&nbsp; I thought you were busy over that School Board
case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I ought really to be in
London, but the truth is I&rsquo;m rather expecting something to
happen down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he replied hesitatingly, as though he
would rather not talk about it, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly know
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come from London to Edinburgh, and
don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ve come for!&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; he said, still more reluctantly,
as it seemed to me, &ldquo;it was Maria&rsquo;s idea; she
wished&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maria!&rdquo; I interrupted, looking perhaps a little
sternly at him, &ldquo;who&rsquo;s Maria?&rdquo;&nbsp; (His
wife&rsquo;s name I knew was Emily Georgina Anne.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I forgot,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;she
never would tell her name before you, would she?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
the Spirit, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s she that has
sent you here.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t she tell you what
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what
worries me.&nbsp; All she would say was, &lsquo;Go to
Edinburgh&mdash;something will happen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how long are you going to remain here?&rdquo; I
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here a week already, and Jobstock writes
quite angrily.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t have come if Maria
hadn&rsquo;t been so urgent.&nbsp; She repeated it three evenings
running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hardly knew what to do.&nbsp; The little man was so
dreadfully in earnest about the business that one could not argue
much with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure,&rdquo; I said, after thinking a while,
&ldquo;that this Maria is a good Spirit?&nbsp; There are all
sorts going about, I&rsquo;m told.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re sure this
isn&rsquo;t the spirit of some deceased lunatic, playing the fool
with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of that,&rdquo; he admitted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course that might be so.&nbsp; If nothing happens soon
I shall almost begin to suspect it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should certainly make some inquiries into its
character before I trusted it any further,&rdquo; I answered, and
left him.</p>
<p>About a month later I ran against him outside the Law
Courts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all right about Maria; something did happen in
Edinburgh while I was there.&nbsp; That very morning I met you
one of my oldest clients died quite suddenly at his house at
Queensferry, only a few miles outside the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I
mean, of course, for Maria&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; It was lucky you
went then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not altogether,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;at
least, not in a worldly sense.&nbsp; He left his affairs in a
very complicated state, and his eldest son went straight up to
London to consult me about them, and, not finding me there, and
time being important, went to Kebble.&nbsp; I was rather
disappointed when I got back and heard about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s not a smart
spirit, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;perhaps not.&nbsp; But,
you see, something did really happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that his affection for &ldquo;Maria&rdquo; increased
tenfold, while her attachment to himself became a burden to his
friends.&nbsp; She grew too big for her table, and, dispensing
with all mechanical intermediaries, talked to him direct.&nbsp;
She followed him everywhere.&nbsp; Mary&rsquo;s lamb
couldn&rsquo;t have been a bigger nuisance.&nbsp; She would even
go with him into the bedroom, and carry on long conversations
with him in the middle of the night.&nbsp; His wife objected; she
said it seemed hardly decent, but there was no keeping her
out.</p>
<p>She turned up with him at picnics and Christmas parties.&nbsp;
Nobody heard her speak to him, but it seemed necessary for him to
reply to her aloud, and to see him suddenly get up from his chair
and slip away to talk earnestly to nothing in a corner disturbed
the festivities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should really be glad,&rdquo; he once confessed to
me, &ldquo;to get a little time to myself.&nbsp; She means
kindly, but it <i>is</i> a strain.&nbsp; And then the others
don&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; It makes them nervous.&nbsp; I can see
it does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One evening she caused quite a scene at the club.&nbsp;
Whibley had been playing whist, with the Major for a
partner.&nbsp; At the end of the game the Major, leaning across
the table toward him, asked, in a tone of deadly calm, &ldquo;May
I inquire, sir, whether there was any earthly reason&rdquo; (he
emphasised &ldquo;earthly&rdquo;) &ldquo;for your following my
lead of spades with your only trump?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;am very sorry, Major,&rdquo; replied
Whibley apologetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;somehow felt
I&mdash;I ought to play that queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entirely your own inspiration, or suggested?&rdquo;
persisted the Major, who had, of course, heard of
&ldquo;Maria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whibley admitted the play had been suggested to him.&nbsp; The
Major rose from the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir,&rdquo; said he, with concentrated
indignation, &ldquo;I decline to continue this game.&nbsp; A
human fool I can tolerate for a partner, but if I am to be
hampered by a damned spirit&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no right to say that,&rdquo; cried Whibley
hotly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I apologise,&rdquo; returned the Major coldly;
&ldquo;we will say a blessed spirit.&nbsp; I decline to play
whist with spirits of any kind; and I advise you, sir, if you
intend giving many exhibitions with the lady, first to teach her
the rudiments of the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying which the Major put on his hat and left the club, and I
made Whibley drink a stiff glass of brandy and water, and sent
him and &ldquo;Maria&rdquo; home in a cab.</p>
<p>Whibley got rid of &ldquo;Maria&rdquo; at last.&nbsp; It cost
him in round figures about eight thousand pounds, but his family
said it was worth it.</p>
<p>A Spanish Count hired a furnished house a few doors from
Whibley&rsquo;s, and one evening he was introduced to Whibley,
and came home and had a chat with him.&nbsp; Whibley told him
about &ldquo;Maria,&rdquo; and the Count quite fell in love with
her.&nbsp; He said that if only he had had such a spirit to help
and advise him, it might have altered his whole life.</p>
<p>He was the first man who had ever said a kind word about the
spirit, and Whibley loved him for it.&nbsp; The Count seemed as
though he could never see enough of Whibley after that evening,
and the three of them&mdash;Whibley, the Count, and
&ldquo;Maria&rdquo;&mdash;would sit up half the night talking
together.</p>
<p>The precise particulars I never heard.&nbsp; Whibley was
always very reticent on the matter.&nbsp; Whether
&ldquo;Maria&rdquo; really did exist, and the Count deliberately
set to work to bamboozle her (she was fool enough for anything),
or whether she was a mere hallucination of Whibley&rsquo;s, and
the man tricked Whibley by &ldquo;hypnotic suggestions&rdquo; (as
I believe it is called), I am not prepared to say.&nbsp; The only
thing certain is that &ldquo;Maria&rdquo; convinced Whibley that
the Count had discovered a secret gold mine in Peru.&nbsp; She
said she knew all about it, and counselled Whibley to beg the
Count to let him put a few thousands into the working of
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maria,&rdquo; it appeared, had known the Count
from his boyhood, and could answer for it that he was the most
honourable man in all South America.&nbsp; Possibly enough he
was.</p>
<p>The Count was astonished to find that Whibley knew all about
his mine.&nbsp; Eight thousand pounds was needed to start the
workings, but he had not mentioned it to any one, as he wanted to
keep the whole thing to himself, and thought he could save the
money on his estates in Portugal.&nbsp; However, to oblige
&ldquo;Maria,&rdquo; he would let Whibley supply the money.&nbsp;
Whibley supplied it&mdash;in cash, and no one has ever seen the
Count since.</p>
<p>That broke up Whibley&rsquo;s faith in &ldquo;Maria,&rdquo;
and a sensible doctor, getting hold of him threatened to
prescribe a lunatic asylum for him if ever he found him carrying
on with any spirits again.&nbsp; That completed the cure.</p>
<h2>THE MAN WHO WENT WRONG</h2>
<p>I first met Jack Burridge nearly ten years ago on a certain
North-country race-course.</p>
<p>The saddling bell had just rung for the chief event of the
day.&nbsp; I was sauntering along with my hands in my pockets,
more interested in the crowd than in the race, when a sporting
friend, crossing on his way to the paddock, seized me by the arm
and whispered hoarsely in my ear:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your shirt on Mrs. Waller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put my -?&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your shirt on Mrs. Waller,&rdquo; he repeated still
more impressively, and disappeared in the throng.</p>
<p>I stared after him in blank amazement.&nbsp; Why should I put
my shirt on Mrs. Waller?&nbsp; Even if it would fit a lady.&nbsp;
And how about myself?</p>
<p>I was passing the grand stand, and, glancing up, I saw
&ldquo;Mrs. Waller, twelve to one,&rdquo; chalked on a
bookmaker&rsquo;s board.&nbsp; Then it dawned upon me that
&ldquo;Mrs. Waller&rdquo; was a horse, and, thinking further upon
the matter, I evolved the idea that my friend&rsquo;s advice,
expressed in more becoming language, was &ldquo;Back &lsquo;Mrs.
Waller&rsquo; for as much as you can possibly afford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;I have
backed cast-iron certainties before.&nbsp; Next time I bet upon a
horse I shall make the selection by shutting my eyes and putting
a pin through the card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the seed had taken root.&nbsp; My friend&rsquo;s words
surged in my brain.&nbsp; The birds passing overhead twittered,
&ldquo;Put your shirt on &lsquo;Mrs. Waller.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I reasoned with myself.&nbsp; I reminded myself of my few
former ventures.&nbsp; But the craving to put, if not my shirt,
at all events half a sovereign on &ldquo;Mrs. Waller&rdquo; only
grew the stronger the more strongly I battled against it.&nbsp; I
felt that if &ldquo;Mrs. Waller&rdquo; won and I had nothing on
her, I should reproach myself to my dying day.</p>
<p>I was on the other side of the course.&nbsp; There was no time
to get back to the enclosure.&nbsp; The horses were already
forming for the start.&nbsp; A few yards off, under a white
umbrella, an outside bookmaker was shouting his final prices in
stentorian tones.&nbsp; He was a big, genial-looking man, with an
honest red face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What price &lsquo;Mrs. Waller&rsquo;?&rdquo; I asked
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fourteen to one,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and good
luck to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I handed him half a sovereign, and he wrote me out a
ticket.&nbsp; I crammed it into my waistcoat pocket, and hurried
off to see the race.&nbsp; To my intense astonishment &ldquo;Mrs.
Waller&rdquo; won.&nbsp; The novel sensation of having backed the
winner so excited me that I forgot all about my money, and it was
not until a good hour afterwards that I recollected my bet.</p>
<p>Then I started off to search for the man under the white
umbrella.&nbsp; I went to where I thought I had left him, but no
white umbrella could I find.</p>
<p>Consoling myself with the reflection that my loss served me
right for having been fool enough to trust an outside
&ldquo;bookie,&rdquo; I turned on my heel and began to make my
way back to my seat.&nbsp; Suddenly a voice hailed me:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, sir.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Jack Burridge you
want.&nbsp; Over here, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked round, and there was Jack Burridge at my elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you looking about, sir,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but I could not make you hear.&nbsp; You was looking the
wrong side of the tent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was pleasant to find that his honest face had not belied
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very good of you,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I had
given up all hopes of seeing you.&nbsp; Or,&rdquo; I added with a
smile, &ldquo;my seven pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven pun&rsquo; ten,&rdquo; he corrected me;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re forgetting your own thin
&rsquo;un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed me the money and went back to his stand.</p>
<p>On my way into the town I came across him again.&nbsp; A small
crowd was collected, thoughtfully watching a tramp knocking about
a miserable-looking woman.</p>
<p>Jack, pushing to the front, took in the scene and took off his
coat in the same instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, my fine old English gentleman,&rdquo; he sang
out, &ldquo;come and have a try at me for a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tramp was a burly ruffian, and I have seen better boxers
than Jack.&nbsp; He got himself a black eye, and a nasty cut over
the lip, before he hardly knew where he was.&nbsp; But in spite
of that&mdash;and a good deal more&mdash;he stuck to his man and
finished him.</p>
<p>At the end, as he helped his adversary up, I heard him say to
the fellow in a kindly whisper:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too good a sort, you know, to whollop a
woman.&nbsp; Why, you very near give me a licking.&nbsp; You must
have forgot yourself, matey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fellow interested me.&nbsp; I waited and walked on with
him.&nbsp; He told me about his home in London, at Mile
End&mdash;about his old father and mother, his little brothers
and sisters&mdash;and what he was saving up to do for them.&nbsp;
Kindliness oozed from every pore in his skin.</p>
<p>Many that we met knew him, and all, when they saw his round,
red face, smiled unconsciously.&nbsp; At the corner of the High
Street a pale-faced little drudge of a girl passed us, saying as
she slipped by &ldquo;Good-evening, Mr. Burridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a dart and caught her by the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how is father?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you please, Mr. Burridge, he is out again.&nbsp;
All the mills is closed,&rdquo; answered the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She don&rsquo;t get no better, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s keeping you all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you please, sir, Jimmy&rsquo;s earning something
now,&rdquo; replied the mite.</p>
<p>He took a couple of sovereigns from his waistcoat pocket, and
closed the child&rsquo;s hand upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, my lass, that&rsquo;s all
right,&rdquo; he said, stopping her stammering thanks.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You write to me if things don&rsquo;t get better.&nbsp;
You know where to find Jack Burridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strolling about the streets in the evening, I happened to pass
the inn where he was staying.&nbsp; The parlour window was open,
and out into the misty night his deep, cheery voice, trolling
forth an old-fashioned drinking song, came rolling like a wind,
cleansing the corners of one&rsquo;s heart with its breezy
humanness.&nbsp; He was sitting at the head of the table
surrounded by a crowd of jovial cronies.&nbsp; I lingered for a
while watching the scene.&nbsp; It made the world appear a less
sombre dwelling-place than I had sometimes pictured it.</p>
<p>I determined, on my return to London, to look him up, and
accordingly one evening started to find the little by-street off
the Mile End Road in which he lived.&nbsp; As I turned the corner
he drove up in his dog-cart; it was a smart turn-out.&nbsp; On
the seat beside him sat a neat, withered little old woman, whom
he introduced to me as his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell &rsquo;im it&rsquo;s a fine gell as &rsquo;e
oughter &rsquo;ave up &rsquo;ere aside &rsquo;im,&rdquo; said the
old lady, preparing to dismount, &ldquo;an old woman like me
takes all the paint off the show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get along with yer,&rdquo; he replied laughingly,
jumping down and handing the reins to the lad who had been
waiting, &ldquo;you could give some of the young uns points yet,
mother.&nbsp; I allus promised the old lady as she should ride
behind her own &rsquo;oss one day,&rdquo; he continued, turning
to me, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t I, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; replied the old soul, as she hobbled
nimbly up the steps, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;re a good son, Jack,
ye&rsquo;re a good son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way into the parlour.&nbsp; As he entered every
face lightened up with pleasure, a harmony of joyous welcome
greeted him.&nbsp; The old hard world had been shut out with the
slam of the front door.&nbsp; I seemed to have wandered into
Dickensland.&nbsp; The red-faced man with the small twinkling
eyes and the lungs of leather loomed before me, a large, fat
household fairy.&nbsp; From his capacious pockets came forth
tobacco for the old father; a huge bunch of hot-house grapes for
a neighbour&rsquo;s sickly child, who was stopping with them; a
book of Henty&rsquo;s&mdash;beloved of boys&mdash;for a noisy
youngster who called him &ldquo;uncle&rdquo;; a bottle of port
wine for a wan, elderly woman with a swollen face&mdash;his
widowed sister-in-law, as I subsequently learned; sweets enough
for the baby (whose baby I don&rsquo;t know) to make it sick for
a week; and a roll of music for his youngest sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a-going to make a lady of her,&rdquo; he
said, drawing the child&rsquo;s shy face against his gaudy
waistcoat, and running his coarse hand through her pretty curls;
&ldquo;and she shall marry a jockey when she grows up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After supper he brewed some excellent whisky punch, and
insisted upon the old lady joining us, which she eventually did
with much coughing and protestation; but I noticed that she
finished the tumblerful.&nbsp; For the children he concocted a
marvellous mixture, which he called an
&ldquo;eye-composer,&rdquo; the chief ingredients being hot
lemonade, ginger wine, sugar, oranges, and raspberry
vinegar.&nbsp; It had the desired effect.</p>
<p>I stayed till late, listening to his inexhaustible fund of
stories.&nbsp; Over most of them he laughed with us
himself&mdash;a great gusty laugh that made the cheap glass
ornaments upon the mantelpiece to tremble; but now and then a
recollection came to him that spread a sudden gravity across his
jovial face, bringing a curious quaver into his deep voice.</p>
<p>Their tongues a little loosened by the punch, the old folks
would have sung his praises to the verge of tediousness had he
not almost sternly interrupted them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, mother,&rdquo; he cried at last, quite
gruffly, &ldquo;what I does I does to please myself.&nbsp; I
likes to see people comfortable about me.&nbsp; If they
wasn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s me as would be more upset than
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not see him again for nearly two years.&nbsp; Then one
October evening, strolling about the East End, I met him coming
out of a little Chapel in the Burdett Road.&nbsp; He was so
changed that I should not have known him had not I overheard a
woman as she passed him say, &ldquo;Good-evening, Mr.
Burridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pair of bushy side-whiskers had given to his red face an
aggressively respectable appearance.&nbsp; He was dressed in an
ill-fitting suit of black, and carried an umbrella in one hand
and a book in the other.</p>
<p>In some mysterious way he managed to look both thinner and
shorter than my recollection of him.&nbsp; Altogether, he
suggested to me the idea that he himself&mdash;the real
man&mdash;had by some means or other been extracted, leaving only
his shrunken husk behind.&nbsp; The genial juices of humanity had
been squeezed out of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Jack Burridge!&rdquo; I exclaimed, confronting him
in astonishment.</p>
<p>His little eyes wandered shiftily up and down the
street.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he replied (his tones had
lost their windy boisterousness&mdash;a hard, metallic voice
spoke to me), &ldquo;not the one as you used to know, praise be
the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you given up the old business?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all
over; I&rsquo;ve been a vile sinner in my time, God forgive me
for it.&nbsp; But, thank Heaven, I have repented in
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and have a drink,&rdquo; I said, slipping my arm
through his, &ldquo;and tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He disengaged himself from me, firmly but gently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You mean well, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I have
given up the drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently he would have been rid of me, but a literary man,
scenting material for his stockpot, is not easily shaken
off.&nbsp; I asked after the old folks, and if they were still
stopping with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for the present.&nbsp; Of
course, a man can&rsquo;t be expected to keep people for ever; so
many mouths to fill is hard work these times, and everybody
sponges on a man just because he&rsquo;s good-natured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how are you getting on?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tolerably well, thank you, sir.&nbsp; The Lord provides
for His servants,&rdquo; he replied with a smug smile.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have got a little shop now in the Commercial
Road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereabouts?&rdquo; I persisted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would
like to call and see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave me the address reluctantly, and said he would esteem
it a great pleasure if I would honour him by a visit, which was a
palpable lie.</p>
<p>The following afternoon I went.&nbsp; I found the place to be
a pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop, and from all appearances he must have
been doing a very brisk business.&nbsp; He was out himself
attending a temperance committee, but his old father was behind
the counter, and asked me inside.&nbsp; Though it was a chilly
day there was no fire in the parlour, and the two old folks sat
one each side of the empty hearth, silent and sad.&nbsp; They
seemed little more pleased to see me than their son, but after a
while Mrs. Burridge&rsquo;s natural garrulity asserted itself,
and we fell into chat.</p>
<p>I asked what had become of his sister-in-law, the lady with
the swollen face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t rightly tell you, sir,&rdquo; answered
the old lady, &ldquo;she ain&rsquo;t livin&rsquo; with us
now.&nbsp; You see, sir,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;John&rsquo;s got different notions to what &rsquo;e used
to &rsquo;ave.&nbsp; &rsquo;E don&rsquo;t cotten much to them as
ain&rsquo;t found grace, and poor Jane never did &rsquo;ave much
religion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the little one?&rdquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
one with the curls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Bessie, sir?&rdquo; said the old lady.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s out at service, sir; John don&rsquo;t
think it good for young folks to be idle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your son seems to have changed a good deal, Mrs.
Burridge,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, sir,&rdquo; she assented, &ldquo;you may well say
that.&nbsp; It nearly broke my &rsquo;art at fust;
everythin&rsquo; so different to what it &rsquo;ad been.&nbsp;
Not as I&rsquo;d stand in the boy&rsquo;s light.&nbsp; If our
being a bit uncomfortable like in this world is a-going to do
&rsquo;im any good in the next me and father ain&rsquo;t the ones
to begrudge it, are we, old man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;old man&rdquo; concurred grumpily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it a sudden conversion?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How did it come about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a young woman as started &rsquo;im off,&rdquo;
explained the old lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;She come round to our place
one day a-collectin&rsquo; for somethin&rsquo; or other, and
Jack, in &rsquo;is free-&rsquo;anded way, &rsquo;e give &rsquo;er
a five-pun&rsquo; note.&nbsp; Next week she come agen for
somethin&rsquo; else, and stopped and talked to &rsquo;im about
&rsquo;is soul in the passage.&nbsp; She told &rsquo;im as
&rsquo;e was a-goin&rsquo; straight to &rsquo;ell, and that
&rsquo;e oughter give up the bookmakin&rsquo; and settle down to
a respec&rsquo;ble, God-fearin&rsquo; business.&nbsp; At fust
&rsquo;e only laughed, but she lammed in tracts at &rsquo;im full
of the most awful language; and one day she fetched &rsquo;im
round to one of them revivalist chaps, as fair settled
&rsquo;im.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E ain&rsquo;t never been his old self since
then.&nbsp; &rsquo;E give up the bettin&rsquo; and bought this
&rsquo;ere, though what&rsquo;s the difference blessed if I can
see.&nbsp; It makes my &rsquo;eart ache, it do, to &rsquo;ear my
Jack a-beatin&rsquo; down the poor people&mdash;and it
ain&rsquo;t like &rsquo;im.&nbsp; It went agen &rsquo;is grain at
fust, I could see; but they told him as &rsquo;ow it was
folks&rsquo;s own fault that they was poor, and as &rsquo;ow it
was the will of God, because they was a drinkin&rsquo;,
improvident lot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they made &rsquo;im sign the pledge.&nbsp;
&rsquo;E&rsquo;d allus been used to &rsquo;is glass, Jack
&rsquo;ad, and I think as knockin&rsquo; it off &rsquo;ave soured
&rsquo;im a bit&mdash;seems as if all the sperit &rsquo;ad gone
out of &rsquo;im&mdash;and of course me and father &rsquo;ave
&rsquo;ad to give up our little drop too.&nbsp; Then they told
&rsquo;im as &rsquo;e must give up smokin&rsquo;- that was
another way of goin&rsquo; straight to &rsquo;ell&mdash;and that
ain&rsquo;t made &rsquo;im any the more cheerful like, and father
misses &rsquo;is little bit&mdash;don&rsquo;t ye,
father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; answered the old fellow savagely;
&ldquo;can&rsquo;t say I thinks much of these &rsquo;ere folks as
is going to heaven; blowed if I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll
be a chirpier lot in t&rsquo;other place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An angry discussion in the shop interrupted us.&nbsp; Jack had
returned, and was threatening an excited woman with the
police.&nbsp; It seemed she had miscalculated the date, and had
come a day too late with her interest.</p>
<p>Having got rid of her, he came into the parlour with the watch
in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s providential she was late,&rdquo; he said,
looking at it; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s worth ten times what I lent on
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He packed his father back into the shop, and his mother down
into the kitchen to get his tea, and for a while we sat together
talking.</p>
<p>I found his conversation a strange mixture of self-laudation,
showing through a flimsy veil of self-disparagement, and of
satisfaction at the conviction that he was &ldquo;saved,&rdquo;
combined with equally evident satisfaction that most other people
weren&rsquo;t&mdash;somewhat trying, however; and, remembering an
appointment, rose to go.</p>
<p>He made no effort to stay me, but I could see that he was
bursting to tell me something.&nbsp; At last, taking a religious
paper from his pocket, and pointing to a column, he blurted
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t take any interest in the Lord&rsquo;s
vineyard, I suppose, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced at the part of the paper indicated.&nbsp; It
announced a new mission to the Chinese, and heading the
subscription list stood the name, &ldquo;Mr. John Burridge, one
hundred guineas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You subscribe largely, Mr. Burridge,&rdquo; I said,
handing him back the paper.</p>
<p>He rubbed his big hands together.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lord will
repay a hundredfold,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In which case it&rsquo;s just as well to have a note of
the advance down in black and white, eh?&rdquo; I added.</p>
<p>His little eyes looked sharply at me; but he made no reply,
and, shaking hands, I left him.</p>
<h2>THE HOBBY RIDER</h2>
<p>Bump.&nbsp; Bump.&nbsp; Bump-bump.&nbsp; Bump.</p>
<p>I sat up in bed and listened intently.&nbsp; It seemed to me
as if someone with a muffled hammer were trying to knock bricks
out of the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burglars,&rdquo; I said to myself (one assumes, as a
matter of course, that everything happening in this world after 1
a.m. is due to burglars), and I reflected what a curiously
literal, but at the same time slow and cumbersome, method of
housebreaking they had adopted.</p>
<p>The bumping continued irregularly, yet uninterruptedly.</p>
<p>My bed was by the window.&nbsp; I reached out my hand and drew
aside a corner of the curtain.&nbsp; The sunlight streamed into
the room.&nbsp; I looked at my watch: it was ten minutes past
five.</p>
<p>A most unbusinesslike hour for burglars, I thought.&nbsp; Why,
it will be breakfast-time before they get in.</p>
<p>Suddenly there came a crash, and some substance striking
against the blind fell upon the floor.&nbsp; I sprang out of bed
and threw open the window.</p>
<p>A red-haired young gentleman, scantily clad in a sweater and a
pair of flannel trousers, stood on the lawn below me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he said cheerily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
you mind throwing me back my ball?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ball?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My tennis ball,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
must be somewhere in the room; it went clean through the
window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found the ball and threw it back to him,</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Playing tennis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am just practising
against the side of the house.&nbsp; It improves your game
wonderfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t improve my night&rsquo;s rest,&rdquo; I
answered somewhat surlily I fear.&nbsp; &ldquo;I came down here
for peace and quiet.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you do it in the
daytime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daytime!&rdquo; he laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why it has
been daytime for the last two hours.&nbsp; Never mind, I&rsquo;ll
go round the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He disappeared round the corner, and set to work at the back,
where he woke up the dog.&nbsp; I heard another window smash,
followed by a sound as of somebody getting up violently in a
distant part of the house, and shortly afterwards I must have
fallen asleep again.</p>
<p>I had come to spend a few weeks at a boarding establishment in
Deal.&nbsp; He was the only other young man in the house, and I
was naturally thrown a good deal upon his society.&nbsp; He was a
pleasant, genial young fellow, but he would have been better
company had he been a little less enthusiastic as regards
tennis.</p>
<p>He played tennis ten hours a day on the average.&nbsp; He got
up romantic parties to play it by moonlight (when half his time
was generally taken up in separating his opponents), and godless
parties to play it on Sundays.&nbsp; On wet days I have seen him
practising services by himself in a mackintosh and goloshes.</p>
<p>He had been spending the winter with his people at Tangiers,
and I asked him how he liked the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a beast of a hole!&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is not a court anywhere in the town.&nbsp; We tried
playing on the roof, but the <i>mater</i> thought it
dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Switzerland he had been delighted with.&nbsp; He counselled me
next time I went to stay at Zermatt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a capital court at Zermatt,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You might almost fancy yourself at
Wimbledon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A mutual acquaintance whom I subsequently met told me that at
the top of the Jungfrau he had said to him, his eyes fixed the
while upon a small snow plateau enclosed by precipices a few
hundred feet below them&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&nbsp; That wouldn&rsquo;t make half a bad
little tennis court&mdash;that flat bit down there.&nbsp; Have to
be careful you didn&rsquo;t run back too far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was not playing tennis, or practising tennis, or
reading about tennis, he was talking about tennis.&nbsp; Renshaw
was the prominent figure in the tennis world at that time, and he
mentioned Renshaw until there grew up within my soul a dark
desire to kill Renshaw in a quiet, unostentatious way, and bury
him.</p>
<p>One drenching afternoon he talked tennis to me for three hours
on end, referring to Renshaw, so far as I kept count, four
thousand nine hundred and thirteen times.&nbsp; After tea he drew
his chair to the window beside me, and commenced&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever noticed how Renshaw&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose someone took a gun&mdash;someone who could aim
very straight&mdash;and went out and shot Renshaw till he was
quite dead, would you tennis players drop him and talk about
somebody else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but who would shoot Renshaw?&rdquo; he said
indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;supposing someone
did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, there would be his brother,&rdquo; he
replied.</p>
<p>I had forgotten that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t argue about how many of them there
are,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suppose someone killed the lot,
should we hear less of Renshaw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; he replied emphatically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Renshaw will always be a name wherever tennis is spoken
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I dread to think what the result might have been had his
answer been other than it was.</p>
<p>The next year he dropped tennis completely and became an
ardent amateur photographer, whereupon all his friends implored
him to return to tennis, and sought to interest him in talk about
services and returns and volleys, and in anecdotes concerning
Renshaw.&nbsp; But he would not heed them.</p>
<p>Whatever he saw, wherever he went, he took.&nbsp; He took his
friends, and made them his enemies.&nbsp; He took babies, and
brought despair to fond mothers&rsquo; hearts.&nbsp; He took
young wives, and cast a shadow on the home.&nbsp; Once there was
a young man who loved not wisely, so his friends thought, but the
more they talked against her the more he clung to her.&nbsp; Then
a happy idea occurred to the father.&nbsp; He got Begglely to
photograph her in seven different positions.</p>
<p>When her lover saw the first, he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an awful looking thing!&nbsp; Who did
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Begglely showed him the second, he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear fellow, it&rsquo;s not a bit like
her.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve made her look an ugly old
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the third he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever have you done to her feet?&nbsp; They
can&rsquo;t be that size, you know.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t in
nature!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the fourth he exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, heavens, man!&nbsp; Look at the shape you&rsquo;ve
made her.&nbsp; Where on earth did you get the idea
from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the first glimpse of the fifth he staggered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; he cried with a shudder,
&ldquo;what a ghastly expression you&rsquo;ve got into it!&nbsp;
It isn&rsquo;t human!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Begglely was growing offended, but the father, who was
standing by, came to his defence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to do with Begglely,&rdquo;
exclaimed the old gentleman suavely.&nbsp; &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t
be <i>his</i> fault.&nbsp; What is a photographer?&nbsp; Simply
an instrument in the hands of science.&nbsp; He arranges his
apparatus, and whatever is in front of it comes into
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; continued the old gentleman, laying a
constrained hand upon Begglely, who was about to resume the
exhibition, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t show him the
other two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was sorry for the poor girl, for I believe she really cared
for the youngster; and as for her looks, they were quite up to
the average.&nbsp; But some evil sprite seemed to have got into
Begglely&rsquo;s camera.&nbsp; It seized upon defects with the
unerring instinct of a born critic, and dilated upon them to the
obscuration of all virtues.&nbsp; A man with a pimple became a
pimple with a man as background.&nbsp; People with strongly
marked features became merely adjuncts to their own noses.&nbsp;
One man in the neighbourhood had, undetected, worn a wig for
fourteen years.&nbsp; Begglely&rsquo;s camera discovered the
fraud in an instant, and so completely exposed it that the
man&rsquo;s friends wondered afterwards how the fact ever could
have escaped them.&nbsp; The thing seemed to take a pleasure in
showing humanity at its very worst.&nbsp; Babies usually came out
with an expression of low cunning.&nbsp; Most young girls had to
take their choice of appearing either as simpering idiots or
embryo vixens.&nbsp; To mild old ladies it generally gave a look
of aggressive cynicism.&nbsp; Our vicar, as excellent an old
gentleman as ever breathed, Begglely presented to us as a
beetle-browed savage of a peculiarly low type of intellect; while
upon the leading solicitor of the town he bestowed an expression
of such thinly-veiled hypocrisy that few who saw the photograph
cared ever again to trust him with their affairs.</p>
<p>As regards myself I should, perhaps, make no comment, I am
possibly a prejudiced party.&nbsp; All I will say, therefore, is
that if I in any way resemble Begglely&rsquo;s photograph of me,
then the critics are fully justified in everything they have at
any time, anywhere, said of me&mdash;and more.&nbsp; Nor, I
maintain&mdash;though I make no pretence of possessing the figure
of Apollo&mdash;is one of my legs twice the length of the other,
and neither does it curve upwards.&nbsp; This I can prove.&nbsp;
Begglely allowed that an accident had occurred to the negative
during the process of development, but this explanation does not
appear on the picture, and I cannot help feeling that an
injustice has been done me.</p>
<p>His perspective seemed to be governed by no law either human
or divine.&nbsp; I have seen a photograph of his uncle and a
windmill, judging from which I defy any unprejudiced person to
say which is the bigger, the uncle or the mill.</p>
<p>On one occasion he created quite a scandal in the parish by
exhibiting a well-known and eminently respectable maiden lady
nursing a young man on her knee.&nbsp; The gentleman&rsquo;s face
was indistinct, and he was dressed in a costume which, upon a man
of his size&mdash;one would have estimated him as rising 6 ft. 4
in.&mdash;appeared absurdly juvenile.&nbsp; He had one arm round
her neck, and she was holding his other hand and smirking.</p>
<p>I, knowing something of Begglely&rsquo;s machine, willingly
accepted the lady&rsquo;s explanation, which was to the effect
that the male in question was her nephew, aged eleven; but the
uncharitable ridiculed this statement, and appearances were
certainly against her.</p>
<p>It was in the early days of the photographic craze, and an
inexperienced world was rather pleased with the idea of being
taken on the cheap.&nbsp; The consequence was that nearly
everyone for three miles round sat or stood or leant or laid to
Begglely at one time or another, with the result that a less
conceited parish than ours it would have been difficult to
discover.&nbsp; No one who had once looked upon a photograph of
himself taken by Begglely ever again felt any pride in his
personal appearance.&nbsp; The picture was invariably a
revelation to him.</p>
<p>Later, some evil-disposed person invented Kodaks, and Begglely
went everywhere slung on to a thing that looked like an overgrown
missionary box, and that bore a legend to the effect that if
Begglely would pull the button, a shameless Company would do the
rest.&nbsp; Life became a misery to Begglely&rsquo;s
friends.&nbsp; Nobody dared to do anything for fear of being
taken in the act.&nbsp; He took an instantaneous photograph of
his own father swearing at the gardener, and snapped his youngest
sister and her lover at the exact moment of farewell at the
garden gate.&nbsp; Nothing was sacred to him.&nbsp; He Kodaked
his aunt&rsquo;s funeral from behind, and showed the chief
mourner but one whispering a funny story into the ear of the
third cousin as they stood behind their hats beside the
grave.</p>
<p>Public indignation was at its highest when a new comer to the
neighbourhood, a young fellow named Haynoth, suggested the
getting together of a party for a summer&rsquo;s tour in
Turkey.&nbsp; Everybody took up the idea with enthusiasm, and
recommended Begglely as the &ldquo;party.&rdquo;&nbsp; We had
great hopes from that tour.&nbsp; Our idea was that Begglely
would pull his button outside a harem or behind a sultana, and
that a Bashi Bazouk or a Janissary would do the rest for us.</p>
<p>We were, however, partly doomed to disappointment&mdash;I say,
&ldquo;partly,&rdquo; because, although Begglely returned alive,
he came back entirely cured of his photographic craze.&nbsp; He
said that every English-speaking man, woman, or child whom he met
abroad had its camera with it, and that after a time the sight of
a black cloth or the click of a button began to madden him.</p>
<p>He told us that on the summit of Mount Tutra, in the
Carpathians, the English and American amateur photographers
waiting to take &ldquo;the grand panorama&rdquo; were formed by
the Hungarian police in queue, two abreast, each with his or her
camera under his or her arm, and that a man had to stand
sometimes as long as three and a half hours before his turn came
round.&nbsp; He also told us that the beggars in Constantinople
went about with placards hung round their necks, stating their
charges for being photographed.&nbsp; One of these price lists he
brought back with him as a sample.</p>
<p>It ran:&mdash;</p>

<p>He said that in some instances where a man had an
exceptionally villainous cast of countenance, or was
exceptionally deformed, as much as twenty francs were demanded
and readily obtained.</p>
<p>He abandoned photography and took to golf.&nbsp; He showed
people how, by digging a hole here and putting a brickbat or two
there, they could convert a tennis-lawn into a miniature golf
link,&mdash;and did it for them.&nbsp; He persuaded elderly
ladies and gentlemen that it was the mildest exercise going, and
would drag them for miles over wet gorse and heather, and bring
them home dead beat, coughing, and full of evil thoughts.</p>
<p>The last time I saw him was in Switzerland, a few months
ago.&nbsp; He appeared indifferent to the subject of golf, but
talked much about whist.&nbsp; We met by chance at Grindelwald,
and agreed to climb the Faulhorn together next morning.&nbsp;
Half-way up we rested, and I strolled on a little way by myself
to gain a view.&nbsp; Returning, I found him with a
&ldquo;Cavendish&rdquo; in his hand and a pack of cards spread
out before him on the grass, solving a problem.</p>
<h2>THE MAN WHO DID NOT BELIEVE IN LUCK</h2>
<p>He got in at Ipswich with seven different weekly papers under
his arm.&nbsp; I noticed that each one insured its reader against
death or injury by railway accident.&nbsp; He arranged his
luggage upon the rack above him, took off his hat and laid it on
the seat beside him, mopped his bald head with a red silk
handkerchief, and then set to work steadily to write his name and
address upon each of the seven papers.&nbsp; I sat opposite to
him and read <i>Punch</i>.&nbsp; I always take the old humour
when travelling; I find it soothing to the nerves.</p>
<p>Passing over the points at Manningtree the train gave a lurch,
and a horse-shoe he had carefully placed in the rack above him
slipped through the netting, falling with a musical ring upon his
head.</p>
<p>He appeared neither surprised nor angry.&nbsp; Having
staunched the wound with his handkerchief, he stooped and picked
the horse-shoe up, glanced at it with, as I thought, an
expression of reproach, and dropped it gently out of the
window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it hurt you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>It was a foolish question.&nbsp; I told myself so the moment I
had uttered it.&nbsp; The thing must have weighed three pounds at
the least; it was an exceptionally large and heavy shoe.&nbsp;
The bump on his head was swelling visibly before my eyes.&nbsp;
Anyone but an idiot must have seen that he was hurt.&nbsp; I
expected an irritable reply.&nbsp; I should have given one myself
had I been in his place.&nbsp; Instead, however, he seemed to
regard the inquiry as a natural and kindly expression of
sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did, a little,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you doing with it?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; It
was an odd sort of thing for a man to be travelling with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was lying in the roadway just outside the
station,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;I picked it up for
luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He refolded his handkerchief so as to bring a cooler surface
in contact with the swelling, while I murmured something genial
about the inscrutability of Providence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a deal of
luck in my time, but it&rsquo;s never turned out well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was born on a Wednesday,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;which, as I daresay you know, is the luckiest day a man
can be born on.&nbsp; My mother was a widow, and none of my
relatives would do anything for me.&nbsp; They said it would be
like taking coals to Newcastle, helping a boy born on a
Wednesday; and my uncle, when he died, left every penny of his
money to my brother Sam, as a slight compensation to him for
having been born on a Friday.&nbsp; All I ever got was advice
upon the duties and responsibilities of wealth, when it arrived,
and entreaties that I would not neglect those with claims upon me
when I came to be a rich man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused while folding up his various insurance papers and
placing them in the inside breast-pocket of his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there are black cats,&rdquo; he went on;
&ldquo;they&rsquo;re said to be lucky.&nbsp; Why, there never was
a blacker cat than the one that followed me into my rooms in
Bolsover Street the very first night I took them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t it bring you luck?&rdquo; I enquired,
finding that he had stopped.</p>
<p>A far-away look came into his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course it all depends,&rdquo; he answered
dreamily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;d never have suited one
another; you can always look at it that way.&nbsp; Still,
I&rsquo;d like to have tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat staring out of the window, and for a while I did not
care to intrude upon his evidently painful memories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened then?&rdquo; I asked, however, at
last.</p>
<p>He roused himself from his reverie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing
extraordinary.&nbsp; She had to leave London for a time, and gave
me her pet canary to take charge of while she was
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t your fault,&rdquo; I urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, perhaps not,&rdquo; he agreed; &ldquo;but it
created a coldness which others were not slow to take advantage
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I offered her the cat, too,&rdquo; he added, but more
to himself than to me.</p>
<p>We sat and smoked in silence.&nbsp; I felt that the
consolations of a stranger would sound weak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Piebald horses are lucky, too,&rdquo; he observed,
knocking the ashes from his pipe against the window sash.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I had one of them once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did it do to you?&rdquo; I enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost me the best crib I ever had in my life,&rdquo; was
the simple rejoinder.&nbsp; &ldquo;The governor stood it a good
deal longer than I had any right to expect; but you can&rsquo;t
keep a man who is <i>always</i> drunk.&nbsp; It gives a firm a
bad name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would,&rdquo; I agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I never had the head
for it.&nbsp; To some men it would not have so much mattered, but
the very first glass was enough to upset me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
never been used to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did you take it?&rdquo; I persisted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The horse didn&rsquo;t make you drink, did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was this way,&rdquo; he explained, continuing
to rub gently the lump which was now about the size of an
egg.&nbsp; &ldquo;The animal had belonged to a gentleman who
travelled in the wine and spirit line, and who had been
accustomed to visit in the way of business almost every
public-house he came to.&nbsp; The result was you couldn&rsquo;t
get that little horse past a public-house &mdash;at least I
couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He sighted them a quarter of a mile off,
and made straight for the door.&nbsp; I struggled with him at
first, but it was five to ten minutes&rsquo; work getting him
away, and folks used to gather round and bet on us.&nbsp; I
think, maybe, I&rsquo;d have stuck to it, however, if it
hadn&rsquo;t been for a temperance chap who stopped one day and
lectured the crowd about it from the opposite side of the
street.&nbsp; He called me Pilgrim, and said the little horse was
&lsquo;Pollion,&rsquo; or some such name, and kept on shouting
out that I was to fight him for a heavenly crown.&nbsp; After
that they called us &ldquo;Polly and the Pilgrim, fighting for
the crown.&rdquo;&nbsp; It riled me, that did, and at the very
next house at which he pulled up I got down and said I&rsquo;d
come for two of Scotch.&nbsp; That was the beginning.&nbsp; It
took me years to break myself of the habit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;it has always
been the same.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t been a fortnight in my first
situation before my employer gave me a goose weighing eighteen
pounds as a Christmas present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that couldn&rsquo;t have done you any
harm,&rdquo; I remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was lucky
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the other clerks said at the time,&rdquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;The old gentleman had never been known to
give anything away before in his life.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s
taken a fancy to you,&rsquo; they said; &lsquo;you are a lucky
beggar!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sighed heavily.&nbsp; I felt there was a story
attached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do with it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the trouble,&rdquo; he returned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what to do with it.&nbsp; It was ten
o&rsquo;clock on Christmas Eve, just as I was leaving, that he
gave it to me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tiddling Brothers have sent me a
goose, Biggles,&rsquo; he said to me as I helped him on with his
great-coat.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very kind of &rsquo;em, but I
don&rsquo;t want it myself; you can have it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I thanked him, and was very grateful.&nbsp;
He wished me a merry Christmas and went out.&nbsp; I tied the
thing up in brown paper, and took it under my arm.&nbsp; It was a
fine bird, but heavy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under all the circumstances, and it being Christmas
time, I thought I would treat myself to a glass of beer.&nbsp; I
went into a quiet little house at the corner of the Lane and laid
the goose on the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a big &rsquo;un,&rsquo; said the
landlord; &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll get a good cut off him
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His words set me thinking, and for the first time it
struck me that I didn&rsquo;t want the bird&mdash;that it was of
no use to me at all.&nbsp; I was going down to spend the holidays
with my young lady&rsquo;s people in Kent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was this the canary young lady?&rdquo; I
interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;This was before
that one.&nbsp; It was this goose I&rsquo;m telling you of that
upset this one.&nbsp; Well, her folks were big farmers; it would
have been absurd taking a goose down to them, and I knew no one
in London to give it to, so when the landlord came round again I
asked him if he would care to buy it.&nbsp; I told him he could
have it cheap,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want it myself,&rsquo; he
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got three in the house
already.&nbsp; Perhaps one of these gentlemen would like to make
an offer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He turned to a couple of chaps who were sitting
drinking gin.&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t look to me worth the price
of a chicken between them.&nbsp; The seediest said he&rsquo;d
like to look at it, however, and I undid the parcel.&nbsp; He
mauled the thing pretty considerably, and cross-examined me as to
how I come by it, ending by upsetting half a tumbler of gin and
water over it.&nbsp; Then he offered me half a crown for
it.&nbsp; It made me so angry that I took the brown paper and the
string in one hand and the goose in the other, and walked
straight out without saying a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I carried it in this way for some distance, because I
was excited and didn&rsquo;t care how I carried it; but as I
cooled, I began to reflect how ridiculous I must look.&nbsp; One
or two small boys evidently noticed the same thing.&nbsp; I
stopped under a lamp-post and tried to tie it up again.&nbsp; I
had a bag and an umbrella with me at the same time, and the first
thing I did was to drop the goose into the gutter, which is just
what I might have expected to do, attempting to handle four
separate articles and three yards of string with one pair of
hands.&nbsp; I picked up about a quart of mud with that goose,
and got the greater part of it over my hands and clothes and a
fair quantity over the brown paper; and then it began to
rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bundled everything up into my arm and made for the
nearest pub, where I thought I would ask for a piece more string
and make a neat job of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bar was crowded.&nbsp; I pushed my way to the
counter and flung the goose down in front of me.&nbsp; The men
nearest stopped talking to look at it; and a young fellow
standing next to me said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve killed it.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
daresay I did seem a bit excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had intended making another effort to sell it here,
but they were clearly not the right sort.&nbsp; I had a pint of
ale&mdash;for I was feeling somewhat tired and hot&mdash;scraped
as much of the mud off the bird as I could, made a fresh parcel
of it, and came out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crossing the road a happy idea occurred to me.&nbsp; I
thought I would raffle it.&nbsp; At once I set to work to find a
house where there might seem to be a likely lot.&nbsp; It cost me
three or four whiskies&mdash;for I felt I didn&rsquo;t want any
more beer, which is a thing that easily upsets me&mdash;but at
length I found just the crowd I wanted&mdash;a quiet
domestic-looking set in a homely little place off the Goswell
Road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I explained my views to the landlord.&nbsp; He said he
had no objection; he supposed I would stand drinks round
afterwards.&nbsp; I said I should be delighted to do so, and
showed him the bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It looks a bit poorly,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; He
was a Devonshire man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing,&rsquo; I
explained.&nbsp; &lsquo;I happened to drop it.&nbsp; That will
all wash off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It smells a bit queer, too,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;That&rsquo;s mud,&rsquo; I answered; &lsquo;you
know what London mud is.&nbsp; And a gentleman spilled some gin
over it.&nbsp; Nobody will notice that when it&rsquo;s
cooked.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll take a hand myself, but if any other
gent likes to, that&rsquo;s his affair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody seemed enthusiastic.&nbsp; I started it at
sixpence, and took a ticket myself.&nbsp; The potman had a free
chance for superintending the arrangements, and he succeeded in
inducing five other men, much against their will, to join
us.&nbsp; I won it myself, and paid out three and twopence for
drinks.&nbsp; A solemn-looking individual who had been snoring in
a corner suddenly woke up as I was going out, and offered me
sevenpence ha&rsquo;penny for it&mdash;why sevenpence
ha&rsquo;penny I have never been able to understand.&nbsp; He
would have taken it away, I should never have seen it again, and
my whole life might have been different.&nbsp; But Fate has
always been against me.&nbsp; I replied, with perhaps unnecessary
hauteur, that I wasn&rsquo;t a Christmas dinner fund for the
destitute, and walked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was getting late, and I had a long walk home to my
lodgings.&nbsp; I was beginning to wish I had never seen the
bird.&nbsp; I estimated its weight by this time to be thirty-six
pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea occurred to me to sell it to a
poulterer.&nbsp; I looked for a shop, I found one in Myddleton
Street.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t a customer near it, but by the
way the man was shouting you might have thought that he was doing
all the trade of Clerkenwell.&nbsp; I took the goose out of the
parcel and laid it on the shelf before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a goose,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You can have it cheap.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He just seized the thing by the neck and flung it at
me.&nbsp; I dodged, and it caught the side of my head.&nbsp; You
can have no idea, if you&rsquo;ve never been hit on the head with
a goose, how if hurts.&nbsp; I picked it up and hit him back with
it, and a policeman came up with the usual, &lsquo;Now then,
what&rsquo;s all this about?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I explained the facts.&nbsp; The poulterer stepped to
the edge of the curb and apostrophised the universe
generally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look at that shop,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s twenty minutes to twelve, and there&rsquo;s
seven dozen geese hanging there that I&rsquo;m willing to give
away, and this fool asks me if I want to buy another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I perceived then that my notion had been a foolish one,
and I followed the policeman&rsquo;s advice, and went away
quietly, taking the bird with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then said I to myself, &lsquo;I will give it
away.&nbsp; I will select some poor deserving person, and make
him a present of the damned thing.&rsquo;&nbsp; I passed a good
many people, but no one looked deserving enough.&nbsp; It may
have been the time or it may have been the neighbourhood, but
those I met seemed to me to be unworthy of the bird.&nbsp; I
offered it to a man in Judd Street, who I thought appeared
hungry.&nbsp; He turned out to be a drunken ruffian.&nbsp; I
could not make him understand what I meant, and he followed me
down the road abusing me at the top of his voice, until, turning
a corner without knowing it, he plunged down Tavistock Place,
shouting after the wrong man.&nbsp; In the Euston Road I stopped
a half-starved child and pressed it upon her.&nbsp; She answered
&lsquo;Not me!&rsquo; and ran away.&nbsp; I heard her calling
shrilly after me, &lsquo;Who stole the goose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dropped it in a dark part of Seymour Street.&nbsp; A
man picked it up and brought it after me.&nbsp; I was unequal to
any more explanations or arguments.&nbsp; I gave him twopence and
plodded on with it once more.&nbsp; The pubs were just closing,
and I went into one for a final drink.&nbsp; As a matter of fact
I had had enough already, being, as I am, unaccustomed to
anything more than an occasional class of beer.&nbsp; But I felt
depressed, and I thought it might cheer me.&nbsp; I think I had
gin, which is a thing I loathe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to fling it over into Oakley Square, but a
policeman had his eye on me, and followed me twice round the
railings.&nbsp; In Golding Road I sought to throw it down an
area, but was frustrated in like manner.&nbsp; The whole night
police of London seemed to have nothing else to do but prevent my
getting rid of that goose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They appeared so anxious about it that I fancied they
might like to have it.&nbsp; I went up to one in Camden
Street.&nbsp; I called him &lsquo;Bobby,&rsquo; and asked him if
he wanted a goose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I don&rsquo;t
want,&rsquo; he replied severely, &lsquo;and that is none of your
sauce.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was very insulting, and I naturally answered him
back.&nbsp; What actually passed I forget, but it ended in his
announcing his intention of taking me in charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I slipped out of his hands and bolted down King
Street.&nbsp; He blew his whistle and started after me.&nbsp; A
man sprang out from a doorway in College Street and tried to stop
me.&nbsp; I tied him up with a butt in the stomach, and cut
through the Crescent, doubling back into the Camden Road by Batt
Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Canal Bridge I looked behind me, and could see
no one.&nbsp; I dropped the goose over the parapet, and it fell
with a splash into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaving a sigh of relief, I turned and crossed into
Randolph Street, and there a constable collared me.&nbsp; I was
arguing with him when the first fool came up breathless.&nbsp;
They told me I had better explain the matter to the Inspector,
and I thought so too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Inspector asked me why I had run away when the
other constable wanted to take me in charge.&nbsp; I replied that
it was because I did not desire to spend my Christmas holidays in
the lock-up, which he evidently regarded as a singularly weak
argument.&nbsp; He asked me what I had thrown into the
canal.&nbsp; I told him a goose.&nbsp; He asked me why I had
thrown a goose into the canal.&nbsp; I told him because I was
sick and tired of the animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this stage a sergeant came in to say that they had
succeeded in recovering the parcel.&nbsp; They opened it on the
Inspector&rsquo;s table.&nbsp; It contained a dead baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pointed out to them that it wasn&rsquo;t my parcel,
and that it wasn&rsquo;t my baby, but they hardly took the
trouble to disguise the fact that they did not believe me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Inspector said it was too grave a case for bail,
which, seeing that I did not know a soul in London, was somewhat
immaterial.&nbsp; I got them to send a telegram to my young lady
to say that I was unavoidably detained in town, and passed as
quiet and uneventful a Christmas Day and Boxing Day as I ever
wish to spend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the end the evidence against me was held to be
insufficient to justify a conviction, and I got off on the minor
charge of drunk and disorderly.&nbsp; But I lost my situation and
I lost my young lady, and I don&rsquo;t care if I never see a
goose again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were nearing Liverpool Street.&nbsp; He collected his
luggage, and taking up his hat made an attempt to put it on his
head.&nbsp; But in consequence of the swelling caused by the
horseshoe it would not go anywhere near him, and he laid it sadly
back upon the seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say
that I believe very much in luck.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>DICK DUNKERMAN&rsquo;S CAT</h2>
<p>Richard Dunkerman and I had been old school-fellows, if a
gentleman belonging to the Upper Sixth, and arriving each morning
in a &ldquo;topper&rdquo; and a pair of gloves, and &ldquo;a
discredit to the Lower Fourth,&rdquo; in a Scotch cap, can by any
manner of means be classed together.&nbsp; And though in those
early days a certain amount of coldness existed between us,
originating in a poem, composed and sung on occasions by myself
in commemoration of an alleged painful incident connected with a
certain breaking-up day, and which, if I remember rightly
ran:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Dicky, Dicky, Dunk,<br />
Always in a funk,<br />
Drank a glass of sherry wine,<br />
And went home roaring drunk,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and kept alive by his brutal criticism of the same, expressed
with the bony part of the knee, yet in after life we came to know
and like each other better.&nbsp; I drifted into journalism,
while he for years had been an unsuccessful barrister and
dramatist; but one spring, to the astonishment of us all, he
brought out the play of the season, a somewhat impossible little
comedy, but full of homely sentiment and belief in human
nature.&nbsp; It was about a couple of months after its
production that he first introduced me to &ldquo;Pyramids,
Esquire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was in love at the time.&nbsp; Her name was, I think, Naomi,
and I wanted to talk to somebody about her.&nbsp; Dick had a
reputation for taking an intelligent interest in other
men&rsquo;s love affairs.&nbsp; He would let a lover rave by the
hour to him, taking brief notes the while in a bulky red-covered
volume labelled &ldquo;Commonplace Book.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course
everybody knew that he was using them merely as raw material for
his dramas, but we did not mind that so long as he would only
listen.&nbsp; I put on my hat and went round to his chambers.</p>
<p>We talked about indifferent matters for a quarter of an hour
or so, and then I launched forth upon my theme.&nbsp; I had
exhausted her beauty and goodness, and was well into my own
feelings&mdash;the madness of my ever imagining I had loved
before, the utter impossibility of my ever caring for any other
woman, and my desire to die breathing her name&mdash;before he
made a move.&nbsp; I thought he had risen to reach down, as
usual, the &ldquo;Commonplace Book,&rdquo; and so waited, but
instead he went to the door and opened it, and in glided one of
the largest and most beautiful black tom-cats I have ever
seen.&nbsp; It sprang on Dick&rsquo;s knee with a soft
&ldquo;cur-roo,&rdquo; and sat there upright, watching me, and I
went on with my tale.</p>
<p>After a few minutes Dick interrupted me with:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said her name was Naomi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;only just now
you referred to her as Enid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was remarkable, as I had not seen Enid for years, and had
quite forgotten her.&nbsp; Somehow it took the glitter out of the
conversation.&nbsp; A dozen sentences later Dick stopped me again
with:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Julia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I began to get irritated.&nbsp; Julia, I remembered, had been
cashier in a city restaurant, and had, when I was little more
than a boy, almost inveigled me into an engagement.&nbsp; I found
myself getting hot at the recollection of the spooney rhapsodies
I had hoarsely poured into her powder-streaked ear while holding
her flabby hand across the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I really say &lsquo;Julia&rsquo;?&rdquo; I answered
somewhat sharply, &ldquo;or are you joking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly alluded to her as Julia,&rdquo; he
replied mildly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But never mind, you go on as you
like, I shall know whom you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the flame was dead within me.&nbsp; I tried to rekindle
it, but every time I glanced up and met the green eyes of the
black Tom it flickered out again.&nbsp; I recalled the thrill
that had penetrated my whole being when Naomi&rsquo;s hand had
accidently touched mine in the conservatory, and wondered whether
she had done it on purpose.&nbsp; I thought how good and sweet
she was to that irritatingly silly old frump her mother, and
wondered if it really were her mother, or only hired.&nbsp; I
pictured her crown of gold-brown hair as I had last seen it with
the sunlight kissing its wanton waves, and felt I would like to
be quite sure that it were all her own.</p>
<p>Once I clutched the flying skirts of my enthusiasm with
sufficient firmness to remark that in my own private opinion a
good woman was more precious than rubies; adding immediately
afterwards&mdash;the words escaping me unconsciously before I was
aware even of the thought&mdash;&ldquo;pity it&rsquo;s so
difficult to tell &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I gave it up, and sat trying to remember what I had said
to her the evening before, and hoping I had not committed
myself.</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s voice roused me from my unpleasant reverie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I thought you would not be
able to.&nbsp; None of them can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of them can what?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; Somehow I
was feeling angry with Dick and with Dick&rsquo;s cat, and with
myself and most other things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why talk love or any other kind of sentiment before old
Pyramids here?&rdquo; he replied, stroking the cat&rsquo;s soft
head as it rose and arched its back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the confounded cat got to do with
it?&rdquo; I snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo;
he answered, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s very remarkable.&nbsp; Old
Leman dropped in here the other evening and began in his usual
style about Ibsen and the destiny of the human race, and the
Socialistic idea and all the rest of it&mdash;you know his
way.&nbsp; Pyramids sat on the edge of the table there and looked
at him, just as he sat looking at you a few minutes ago, and in
less than a quarter of an hour Leman had come to the conclusion
that society would do better without ideals and that the destiny
of the human race was in all probability the dust heap.&nbsp; He
pushed his long hair back from his eyes and looked, for the first
time in his life, quite sane.&nbsp; &lsquo;We talk about
ourselves,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;as though we were the end of
creation.&nbsp; I get tired listening to myself sometimes.&nbsp;
Pah!&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;for all we know the human race
may die out utterly and another insect take our place, as
possibly we pushed out and took the place of a former race of
beings.&nbsp; I wonder if the ant tribe may not be the future
inheritors of the earth.&nbsp; They understand combination, and
already have an extra sense that we lack.&nbsp; If in the courses
of evolution they grow bigger in brain and body, they may become
powerful rivals, who knows?&rsquo;&nbsp; Curious to hear old
Leman talking like that, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you call him &lsquo;Pyramids&rsquo;?&rdquo; I
asked of Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I
suppose because he looked so old.&nbsp; The name came to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I leaned across and looked into the great green eyes, and the
creature, never winking, never blinking, looked back into mine,
until the feeling came to me that I was being drawn down into the
very wells of time.&nbsp; It seemed as though the panorama of the
ages must have passed in review before those expressionless
orbs&mdash;all the loves and hopes and desires of mankind; all
the everlasting truths that have been found false; all the
eternal faiths discovered to save, until it was discovered they
damned.&nbsp; The strange black creature grew and grew till it
seemed to fill the room, and Dick and I to be but shadows
floating in the air.</p>
<p>I forced from myself a laugh, that only in part, however,
broke the spell, and inquired of Dick how he had acquired
possession of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came to me,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;one night six
months ago.&nbsp; I was down on my luck at the time.&nbsp; Two of
my plays, on which I had built great hopes, had failed, one on
top of the other&mdash;you remember them&mdash;and it appeared
absurd to think that any manager would ever look at anything of
mine again.&nbsp; Old Walcott had just told me that he did not
consider it right of me under all the circumstances to hold
Lizzie any longer to her engagement, and that I ought to go away
and give her a chance of forgetting me, and I had agreed with
him.&nbsp; I was alone in the world, and heavily in debt.&nbsp;
Altogether things seemed about as hopeless as they could be, and
I don&rsquo;t mind confessing to you now that I had made up my
mind to blow out my brains that very evening.&nbsp; I had loaded
my revolver, and it lay before me on the desk.&nbsp; My hand was
toying with it when I heard a faint scratching at the door.&nbsp;
I paid no attention at first, but it grew more persistent, and at
length, to stop the faint noise which excited me more than I
could account for, I rose and opened the door and <i>it</i>
walked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It perched itself upon the corner of my desk beside the
loaded pistol, and sat there bolt upright looking at me; and I,
pushing back my chair, sat looking at it.&nbsp; And there came a
letter telling me that a man of whose name I had never heard had
been killed by a cow in Melbourne, and that under his will a
legacy of three thousand pounds fell into the estate of a distant
relative of my own who had died peacefully and utterly insolvent
eighteen months previously, leaving me his sole heir and
representative, and I put the revolver back into the
drawer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Pyramids would come and stop with me for a
week?&rdquo; I asked, reaching over to stroke the cat as it lay
softly purring on Dick&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he will some day,&rdquo; replied Dick in a low
voice, but before the answer came&mdash;I know not why&mdash;I
had regretted the jesting words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to talk to him as though he were a human
creature,&rdquo; continued Dick, &ldquo;and to discuss things
with him.&nbsp; My last play I regard as a collaboration; indeed,
it is far more his than mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should have thought Dick mad had not the cat been sitting
there before me with its eyes looking into mine.&nbsp; As it was,
I only grew more interested in his tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was rather a cynical play as I first wrote
it,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;a truthful picture of a certain
corner of society as I saw and knew it.&nbsp; From an artistic
point of view I felt it was good; from the box-office standard it
was doubtful.&nbsp; I drew it from my desk on the third evening
after Pyramids&rsquo; advent, and read it through.&nbsp; He sat
on the arm of the chair and looked over the pages as I turned
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the best thing I had ever written.&nbsp; Insight
into life ran through every line, I found myself reading it again
with delight.&nbsp; Suddenly a voice beside me said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very clever, my boy, very clever indeed.&nbsp;
If you would just turn it topsy-turvy, change all those bitter,
truthful speeches into noble sentiments; make your
Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs (who never has been a popular
character) die in the last act instead of the Yorkshireman, and
let your bad woman be reformed by her love for the hero and go
off somewhere by herself and be good to the poor in a black
frock, the piece might be worth putting on the stage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I turned indignantly to see who was speaking.&nbsp; The
opinions sounded like those of a theatrical manager.&nbsp; No one
was in the room but I and the cat.&nbsp; No doubt I had been
talking to myself, but the voice was strange to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Be reformed by her love for the hero!&rsquo; I
retorted, contemptuously, for I was unable to grasp the idea that
I was arguing only with myself, &lsquo;why it&rsquo;s his mad
passion for her that ruins his life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And will ruin the play with the great
B.P.,&rsquo; returned the other voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;The British
dramatic hero has no passion, but a pure and respectful
admiration for an honest, hearty English girl&mdash;pronounced
&ldquo;gey-url.&rdquo;&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know the canons of
your art.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And besides,&rsquo; I persisted, unheeding the
interruption, &lsquo;women born and bred and soaked for thirty
years in an atmosphere of sin don&rsquo;t reform.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, this one&rsquo;s got to, that&rsquo;s
all,&rsquo; was the sneering reply, &lsquo;let her hear an
organ.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But as an artist -,&rsquo; I protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You will be always unsuccessful,&rsquo; was the
rejoinder.&nbsp; &lsquo;My dear fellow, you and your plays,
artistic or in artistic, will be forgotten in a very few years
hence.&nbsp; You give the world what it wants, and the world will
give you what you want.&nbsp; Please, if you wish to
live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, with Pyramids beside me day by day, I re-wrote the
play, and whenever I felt a thing to be utterly impossible and
false I put it down with a grin.&nbsp; And every character I made
to talk clap-trap sentiment while Pyramids purred, and I took
care that everyone of my puppets did that which was right in the
eyes of the lady with the lorgnettes in the second row of the
dress circle; and old Hewson says the play will run five hundred
nights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is worst,&rdquo; concluded Dick, &ldquo;is
that I am not ashamed of myself, and that I seem
content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think the animal is?&rdquo; I asked with a
laugh, &ldquo;an evil spirit&rdquo;?&nbsp; For it had passed into
the next room and so out through the open window, and its
strangely still green eyes no longer drawing mine towards them, I
felt my common sense returning to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not lived with it for six months,&rdquo;
answered Dick quietly, &ldquo;and felt its eyes for ever on you
as I have.&nbsp; And I am not the only one.&nbsp; You know Canon
Whycherly, the great preacher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My knowledge of modern church history is not
extensive,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know him by name, of
course.&nbsp; What about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a curate in the East End,&rdquo; continued Dick,
&ldquo;and for ten years he laboured, poor and unknown, leading
one of those noble, heroic lives that here and there men do yet
live, even in this age.&nbsp; Now he is the prophet of the
fashionable up-to-date Christianity of South Kensington, drives
to his pulpit behind a pair of thorough-bred Arabs, and his
waistcoat is taking to itself the curved line of
prosperity.&nbsp; He was in here the other morning on behalf of
Princess ---.&nbsp; They are giving a performance of one of my
plays in aid of the Destitute Vicars&rsquo; Fund.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did Pyramids discourage him?&rdquo; I asked, with
perhaps the suggestion of a sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Dick, &ldquo;so far as I could
judge, it approved the scheme.&nbsp; The point of the matter is
that the moment Whycherly came into the room the cat walked over
to him and rubbed itself affectionately against his legs.&nbsp;
He stood and stroked it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, so it&rsquo;s come to you, has it?&rsquo; he
said, with a curious smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no need for any further explanation between
us.&nbsp; I understood what lay behind those few
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lost sight of Dick for some time, though I heard a good deal
of him, for he was rapidly climbing into the position of the most
successful dramatist of the day, and Pyramids I had forgotten all
about, until one afternoon calling on an artist friend who had
lately emerged from the shadows of starving struggle into the
sunshine of popularity, I saw a pair of green eyes that seemed
familiar to me gleaming at me from a dark corner of the
studio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, surely,&rdquo; I exclaimed, crossing over to
examine the animal more closely, &ldquo;why, yes, you&rsquo;ve
got Dick Dunkerman&rsquo;s cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his face from the easel and glanced across at
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t live on
ideals,&rdquo; and I, remembering, hastened to change the
conversation.</p>
<p>Since then I have met Pyramids in the rooms of many friends of
mine.&nbsp; They give him different names, but I am sure it is
the same cat, I know those green eyes.&nbsp; He always brings
them luck, but they are never quite the same men again
afterwards.</p>
<p>Sometimes I sit wondering if I hear his scratching at the
door.</p>
<h2>THE MINOR POET&rsquo;S STORY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t suit you at all,&rdquo; I
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very disagreeable,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t ever ask your advice again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; I hastened to add, &ldquo;would look
well in it.&nbsp; You, of course, look less awful in it than any
other woman would, but it&rsquo;s not your style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means,&rdquo; exclaimed the Minor Poet, &ldquo;that
the thing itself not being pre-eminently beautiful, it does not
suit, is not in agreement with you.&nbsp; The contrast between
you and anything approaching the ugly or the commonplace, is too
glaring to be aught else than displeasing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say it,&rdquo; replied the Woman of the
World; &ldquo;and besides it isn&rsquo;t ugly.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
the very latest fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it,&rdquo; asked the Philosopher, &ldquo;that
women are such slaves to fashion?&nbsp; They think clothes, they
talk clothes, they read clothes, yet they have never understood
clothes.&nbsp; The purpose of dress, after the primary object of
warmth has been secured, is to adorn, to beautify the particular
wearer.&nbsp; Yet not one woman in a thousand stops to consider
what colours will go best with her complexion, what cut will best
hide the defects or display the advantages of her figure.&nbsp;
If it be the fashion, she must wear it.&nbsp; And so we have
pale-faced girls looking ghastly in shades suitable to
dairy-maids, and dots waddling about in costumes fit and proper
to six-footers.&nbsp; It is as if crows insisted on wearing
cockatoo&rsquo;s feathers on their heads, and rabbits ran about
with peacocks&rsquo; tails fastened behind them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are not you men every bit as foolish?&rdquo;
retorted the Girton Girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sack coats come into
fashion, and dumpy little men trot up and down in them, looking
like butter-tubs on legs.&nbsp; You go about in July melting
under frock-coats and chimney-pot hats, and because it is the
stylish thing to do, you all play tennis in still shirts and
stand-up collars, which is idiotic.&nbsp; If fashion decreed that
you should play cricket in a pair of top-boots and a
diver&rsquo;s helmet, you would play cricket in a pair of
top-boots and a diver&rsquo;s helmet, and dub every sensible
fellow who didn&rsquo;t a cad.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s worse in you than
in us; men are supposed to think for themselves, and to be
capable of it, the womanly woman isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big women and little men look well in nothing,&rdquo;
said the Woman of the World.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor Emily was five
foot ten and a half, and never looked an inch under seven foot,
whatever she wore.&nbsp; Empires came into fashion, and the poor
child looked like the giant&rsquo;s baby in a pantomime.&nbsp; We
thought the Greek might help her, but it only suggested a Crystal
Palace statue tied up in a sheet, and tied up badly; and when
puff-sleeves and shoulder-capes were in and Teddy stood up behind
her at a water-party and sang &lsquo;Under the spreading
chestnut-tree,&rsquo; she took it as a personal insult and boxed
his ears.&nbsp; Few men liked to be seen with her, and I&rsquo;m
sure George proposed to her partly with the idea of saving
himself the expense of a step-ladder, she reaches down his boots
for him from the top shelf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; said the Minor Poet, &ldquo;take up the
position of not wanting to waste my brain upon the subject.&nbsp;
Tell me what to wear, and I will wear it, and there is an end of
the matter.&nbsp; If Society says, &lsquo;Wear blue shirts and
white collars,&rsquo; I wear blue shirts and white collars.&nbsp;
If she says, &lsquo;The time has now come when hats should be
broad-brimmed,&rsquo; I take unto myself a broad-brimmed
hat.&nbsp; The question does not interest me sufficiently for me
to argue it.&nbsp; It is your fop who refuses to follow
fashion.&nbsp; He wishes to attract attention to himself by being
peculiar.&nbsp; A novelist whose books pass unnoticed, gains
distinction by designing his own necktie; and many an artist,
following the line of least resistance, learns to let his hair
grow instead of learning to paint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; remarked the Philosopher, &ldquo;we
are the mere creatures of fashion.&nbsp; Fashion dictates to us
our religion, our morality, our affections, our thoughts.&nbsp;
In one age successful cattle-lifting is a virtue, a few hundred
years later company-promoting takes its place as a respectable
and legitimate business.&nbsp; In England and America
Christianity is fashionable, in Turkey, Mohammedanism, and
&lsquo;the crimes of Clapham are chaste in Martaban.&rsquo;&nbsp;
In Japan a woman dresses down to the knees, but would be
considered immodest if she displayed bare arms.&nbsp; In Europe
it is legs that no pure-minded woman is supposed to
possess.&nbsp; In China we worship our mother-in-law and despise
our wife; in England we treat our wife with respect, and regard
our mother-in-law as the bulwark of comic journalism.&nbsp; The
stone age, the iron age, the age of faith, the age of infidelism,
the philosophic age, what are they but the passing fashions of
the world?&nbsp; It is fashion, fashion, fashion wherever we
turn.&nbsp; Fashion waits beside our cradle to lead us by the
hand through life.&nbsp; Now literature is sentimental, now
hopefully humorous, now psychological, now new-womanly.&nbsp;
Yesterday&rsquo;s pictures are the laughing-stock of the
up-to-date artist of to-day, and to-day&rsquo;s art will be
sneered at to-morrow.&nbsp; Now it is fashionable to be
democratic, to pretend that no virtue or wisdom can exist outside
corduroy, and to abuse the middle classes.&nbsp; One season we go
slumming, and the next we are all socialists.&nbsp; We think we
are thinking; we are simply dressing ourselves up in words we do
not understand for the gods to laugh at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be pessimistic,&rdquo; retorted the Minor
Poet, &ldquo;pessimism is going out.&nbsp; You call such changes
fashions, I call them the footprints of progress.&nbsp; Each
phase of thought is an advance upon the former, bringing the
footsteps of the many nearer to the landmarks left by the mighty
climbers of the past upon the mountain paths of truth.&nbsp; The
crowd that was satisfied with <i>The Derby Day</i> now
appreciates Millet.&nbsp; The public that were content to wag
their heads to <i>The Bohemian Girl</i> have made Wagner
popular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the play lovers, who stood for hours to listen to
Shakespeare,&rdquo; interrupted the Philosopher, &ldquo;now crowd
to music-halls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The track sometimes descends for a little way, but it
will wind upwards again,&rdquo; returned the Poet.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The music-hall itself is improving; I consider it the duty
of every intellectual man to visit such places.&nbsp; The mere
influence of his presence helps to elevate the tone of the
performance.&nbsp; I often go myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was looking,&rdquo; said the Woman of the World,
&ldquo;at some old illustrated papers of thirty years ago,
showing the men dressed in those very absurd trousers, so
extremely roomy about the waist, and so extremely tight about the
ankles.&nbsp; I recollect poor papa in them; I always used to
long to fill them out by pouring in sawdust at the
top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the peg-top period,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I remember them distinctly myself, but it cannot be more
than three-and-twenty years ago at the outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very nice of you,&rdquo; replied the Woman of
the World, &ldquo;and shows more tact than I should have given
you credit for.&nbsp; It could, as you say, have been only
twenty-three years ago.&nbsp; I know I was a very little girl at
the time.&nbsp; I think there must be some subtle connection
between clothes and thought.&nbsp; I cannot imagine men in those
trousers and Dundreary whiskers talking as you fellows are
talking now, any more than I could conceive of a woman in a
crinoline and a poke bonnet smoking a cigarette.&nbsp; I think it
must be so, because dear mother used to be the most easy-going
woman in the world in her ordinary clothes, and would let papa
smoke all over the house.&nbsp; But about once every three weeks
she would put on a hideous old-fashioned black silk dress, that
looked as if Queen Elizabeth must have slept in it during one of
those seasons when she used to go about sleeping anywhere, and
then we all had to sit up.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look out, ma&rsquo;s got
her black silk dress on,&rsquo; came to be a regular
formula.&nbsp; We could always make papa take us out for a walk
or a drive by whispering it to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can never bear to look at those pictures of by-gone
fashions,&rdquo; said the Old Maid, &ldquo;I see the by-gone
people in them, and it makes me feel as though the faces that we
love are only passing fashions with the rest.&nbsp; We wear them
for a little while upon our hearts, and think so much of them,
and then there comes a time when we lay them by, and forget them,
and newer faces take their place, and we are satisfied.&nbsp; It
seems so sad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote a story some years ago,&rdquo; remarked the
Minor Poet, &ldquo;about a young Swiss guide, who was betrothed
to a laughing little French peasant girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Named Suzette,&rdquo; interrupted the Girton
Girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know her.&nbsp; Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Named Jeanne,&rdquo; corrected the Poet, &ldquo;the
majority of laughing French girls, in fiction, are named Suzette,
I am well aware.&nbsp; But this girl&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s
family was English.&nbsp; She was christened Jeanne after an aunt
Jane, who lived in Birmingham, and from whom she had
expectations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; apologised the Girton Girl,
&ldquo;I was not aware of that fact.&nbsp; What happened to
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One morning, a few days before the date fixed for the
wedding,&rdquo; said the Minor Poet, &ldquo;she started off to
pay a visit to a relative living in the village, the other side
of the mountain.&nbsp; It was a dangerous track, climbing
half-way up the mountain before it descended again, and skirting
more than one treacherous slope, but the girl was mountain born
and bred, sure-footed as a goat, and no one dreamed of
harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She went over, of course,&rdquo; said the Philosopher,
&ldquo;those sure-footed girls always do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened,&rdquo; replied the Minor Poet,
&ldquo;was never known.&nbsp; The girl was never seen
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what became of her lover?&rdquo; asked the Girton
Girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was he, when next year&rsquo;s snow melted,
and the young men of the village went forth to gather Edelweiss,
wherewith to deck their sweethearts, found by them dead, beside
her, at the bottom of the crevasse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Poet; &ldquo;you do not know this
story, you had better let me tell it.&nbsp; Her lover returned
the morning before the wedding day, to be met with the
news.&nbsp; He gave way to no sign of grief, he repelled all
consolation.&nbsp; Taking his rope and axe he went up into the
mountain by himself.&nbsp; All through the winter he haunted the
track by which she must have travelled, indifferent to the danger
that he ran, impervious apparently to cold, or hunger, or
fatigue, undeterred by storm, or mist, or avalanche.&nbsp; At the
beginning of the spring he returned to the village, purchased
building utensils, and day after day carried them back with him
up into the mountain.&nbsp; He hired no labour, he rejected the
proffered assistance of his brother guides.&nbsp; Choosing an
almost inaccessible spot, at the edge of the great glacier, far
from all paths, he built himself a hut, with his own hands; and
there for eighteen years he lived alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the &lsquo;season&rsquo; he earned good fees, being
known far and wide as one of the bravest and hardiest of all the
guides, but few of his clients liked him, for he was a silent,
gloomy man, speaking little, and with never a laugh or jest on
the journey.&nbsp; Each fall, having provisioned himself, he
would retire to his solitary hut, and bar the door, and no human
soul would set eyes on him again until the snows melted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One year, however, as the spring days wore on, and he
did not appear among the guides, as was his wont, the elder men,
who remembered his story and pitied him, grew uneasy; and, after
much deliberation, it was determined that a party of them should
force their way up to his eyrie.&nbsp; They cut their path across
the ice where no foot among them had trodden before, and finding
at length the lonely snow-encompassed hut, knocked loudly with
their axe-staves on the door; but only the whirling echoes from
the glacier&rsquo;s thousand walls replied, so the foremost put
his strong shoulder to the worn timber and the door flew open
with a crash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They found him dead, as they had more than half
expected, lying stiff and frozen on the rough couch at the
farther end of the hut; and, beside him, looking down upon him
with a placid face, as a mother might watch beside her sleeping
child, stood Jeanne.&nbsp; She wore the flowers pinned to her
dress that she had gathered when their eyes had last seen
her.&nbsp; The girl&rsquo;s face that had laughed back to their
good-bye in the village, nineteen years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange steely light clung round her, half
illuminating, half obscuring her, and the men drew back in fear,
thinking they saw a vision, till one, bolder than the rest,
stretched out his hand and touched the ice that formed her
coffin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For eighteen years the man had lived there with this
face that he had loved.&nbsp; A faint flush still lingered on the
fair cheeks, the laughing lips were still red.&nbsp; Only at one
spot, above her temple, the wavy hair lay matted underneath a
clot of blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Minor Poet ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a very unpleasant way of preserving one&rsquo;s
love!&rdquo; said the Girton Girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did the story appear?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember reading it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never published it,&rdquo; explained the Minor
Poet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Within the same week two friends of mine, one
of whom had just returned from Norway and the other from
Switzerland, confided to me their intention of writing stories
about girls who had fallen into glaciers, and who had been found
by their friends long afterwards, looking as good as new; and a
few days later I chanced upon a book, the heroine of which had
been dug out of a glacier alive three hundred years after she had
fallen in.&nbsp; There seemed to be a run on ice maidens, and I
decided not to add to their number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is curious,&rdquo; said the Philosopher, &ldquo;how
there seems to be a fashion even in thought.&nbsp; An idea has
often occurred to me that has seemed to me quite new, and taking
up a newspaper I have found that some man in Russia or San
Francisco has just been saying the very same thing in almost the
very same words.&nbsp; We say a thing is &lsquo;in the
air&rsquo;; it is more true than we are aware of.&nbsp; Thought
does not grow in us.&nbsp; It is a thing apart, we simply gather
it.&nbsp; All truths, all discoveries, all inventions, they have
not come to us from any one man.&nbsp; The time grows ripe for
them, and from this corner of the earth and from that, hands,
guided by some instinct, grope for and grasp them.&nbsp; Buddha
and Christ seize hold of the morality needful to civilisation,
and promulgate it, unknown to one another, the one on the shores
of the Ganges, the other by the Jordan.&nbsp; A dozen forgotten
explorers, <i>feeling</i> America, prepared the way for Columbus
to discover it.&nbsp; A deluge of blood is required to sweep away
old follies, and Rousseau and Voltaire, and a myriad others are
set to work to fashion the storm clouds.&nbsp; The steam-engine,

brains are busy with them, a few go further than the rest.&nbsp;
It is idle to talk of human thought; there is no such
thing.&nbsp; Our minds are fed as our bodies with the food God
has provided for us.&nbsp; Thought hangs by the wayside, and we
pick it and cook it, and eat it, and cry out what clever
&lsquo;thinkers&rsquo; we are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot agree with you,&rdquo; replied the Minor Poet,
&ldquo;if we were simply automata, as your argument would
suggest, what was the purpose of creating us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The intelligent portion of mankind has been asking
itself that question for many ages,&rdquo; returned the
Philosopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate people who always think as I do,&rdquo; said the
Girton Girl; &ldquo;there was a girl in our corridor who never
would disagree with me.&nbsp; Every opinion I expressed turned
out to be her opinion also.&nbsp; It always irritated
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might have been weak-mindedness,&rdquo; said the
Old Maid, which sounded ambiguous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not so unpleasant as having a person always
disagreeing with you,&rdquo; said the Woman of the World.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My cousin Susan never would agree with any one.&nbsp; If I
came down in red she would say, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try
green, dear? every one says you look so well in green&rsquo;; and
when I wore green she would say, &lsquo;Why have you given up red
dear?&nbsp; I thought you rather fancied yourself in
red.&rsquo;&nbsp; When I told her of my engagement to Tom, she
burst into tears and said she couldn&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; She
had always felt that George and I were intended for one another;
and when Tom never wrote for two whole months, and behaved
disgracefully in&mdash;in other ways, and I told her I was
engaged to George, she reminded me of every word I had ever said
about my affection for Tom, and of how I had ridiculed poor
George.&nbsp; Papa used to say, &lsquo;If any man ever tells
Susan that he loves her, she will argue him out of it, and will
never accept him until he has jilted her, and will refuse to
marry him every time he asks her to fix the
day.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she married?&rdquo; asked the Philosopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; answered the Woman of the World,
&ldquo;and is devoted to her children.&nbsp; She lets them do
everything they don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>THE DEGENERATION OF THOMAS HENRY</h2>
<p>The most respectable cat I have ever known was Thomas
Henry.&nbsp; His original name was Thomas, but it seemed absurd
to call him that.&nbsp; The family at Hawarden would as soon
think of addressing Mr. Gladstone as &ldquo;Bill.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
came to us from the Reform Club, <i>vi&acirc;</i> the butcher,
and the moment I saw him I felt that of all the clubs in London
that was the club he must have come from.&nbsp; Its atmosphere of
solid dignity and petrified conservatism seemed to cling to
him.&nbsp; Why he left the club I am unable, at this distance of
time, to remember positively, but I am inclined to think that it
came about owing to a difference with the new <i>chef</i>, an
overbearing personage who wanted all the fire to himself.&nbsp;
The butcher, hearing of the quarrel, and knowing us as a catless
family, suggested a way out of the <i>impasse</i> that was
welcomed both by cat and cook.&nbsp; The parting between them, I
believe, was purely formal, and Thomas arrived prejudiced in our
favour.</p>
<p>My wife, the moment she saw him, suggested Henry as a more
suitable name.&nbsp; It struck me that the combination of the two
would be still more appropriate, and accordingly, in the privacy
of the domestic circle, Thomas Henry he was called.&nbsp; When
speaking of him to friends, we generally alluded to him as Thomas
Henry, Esquire.</p>
<p>He approved of us in his quiet, undemonstrative way.&nbsp; He
chose my own particular easy chair for himself, and stuck to
it.&nbsp; An ordinary cat I should have shot out, but Thomas
Henry was not the cat one chivvies.&nbsp; Had I made it clear to
him that I objected to his presence in my chair, I feel convinced
he would have regarded me much as I should expect to be regarded
by Queen Victoria, were that gracious Lady to call upon me in a
friendly way, and were I to inform her that I was busy, and
request her to look in again some other afternoon.&nbsp; He would
have risen, and have walked away, but he never would have spoken
to me again so long as we lived under the same roof.</p>
<p>We had a lady staying with us at the time&mdash;she still
resides with us, but she is now older, and possessed of more
judgment&mdash;who was no respecter of cats.&nbsp; Her argument
was that seeing the tail stuck up, and came conveniently to
one&rsquo;s hand, that was the natural appendage by which to
raise a cat.&nbsp; She also laboured under the error that the way
to feed a cat was to ram things into its head, and that its
pleasure was to be taken out for a ride in a doll&rsquo;s
perambulator.&nbsp; I dreaded the first meeting of Thomas Henry
with this lady.&nbsp; I feared lest she should give him a false
impression of us as a family, and that we should suffer in his
eyes.</p>
<p>But I might have saved myself all anxiety.&nbsp; There was a
something about Thomas Henry that checked forwardness and damped
familiarity.&nbsp; His attitude towards her was friendly but
firm.&nbsp; Hesitatingly, and with a new-born respect for cats,
she put out her hand timidly towards its tail.&nbsp; He gently
put it on the other side, and looked at her.&nbsp; It was not an
angry look nor an offended look.&nbsp; It was the expression with
which Solomon might have received the advances of the Queen of
Sheba.&nbsp; It expressed condescension, combined with
distance.</p>
<p>He was really a most gentlemanly cat.&nbsp; A friend of mine,
who believes in the doctrine of the transmigration of souls, was
convinced that he was Lord Chesterfield.&nbsp; He never clamoured
for food, as other cats do.&nbsp; He would sit beside me at
meals, and wait till he was served.&nbsp; He would eat only the
knuckle-end of a leg of mutton, and would never look at over-done
beef.&nbsp; A visitor of ours once offered him a piece of
gristle; he said nothing, but quietly left the room, and we did
not see him again until our friend had departed.</p>
<p>But every one has his price, and Thomas Henry&rsquo;s price
was roast duck.&nbsp; Thomas Henry&rsquo;s attitude in the
presence of roast duck came to me as a psychological
revelation.&nbsp; It showed me at once the lower and more animal
side of his nature.&nbsp; In the presence of roast duck Thomas
Henry became simply and merely a cat, swayed by all the savage
instincts of his race.&nbsp; His dignity fell from him as a
cloak.&nbsp; He clawed for roast duck, he grovelled for it.&nbsp;
I believe he would have sold himself to the devil for roast
duck.</p>
<p>We accordingly avoided that particular dish: it was painful to
see a cat&rsquo;s character so completely demoralised.&nbsp;
Besides, his manners, when roast duck was on the table, afforded
a bad example to the children.</p>
<p>He was a shining light among all the eats of our
neighbourhood.&nbsp; One might have set one&rsquo;s watch by his
movements.&nbsp; After dinner he invariably took half an
hour&rsquo;s constitutional in the square; at ten o&rsquo;clock
each night, precisely, he returned to the area door, and at
eleven o&rsquo;clock he was asleep in my easy chair.&nbsp; He
made no friends among the other cats.&nbsp; He took no pleasure
in fighting, and I doubt his ever having loved, even in youth;
his was too cold and self-contained a nature, female society he
regarded with utter indifference.</p>
<p>So he lived with us a blameless existence during the whole
winter.&nbsp; In the summer we took him down with us into the
country.&nbsp; We thought the change of air would do him good; he
was getting decidedly stout.&nbsp; Alas, poor Thomas Henry! the
country was his ruin.&nbsp; What brought about the change I
cannot say: maybe the air was too bracing.&nbsp; He slid down the
moral incline with frightful rapidity.&nbsp; The first night he
stopped out till eleven, the second night he never came home at
all, the third night he came home at six o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, minus half the fur on the top of his head.&nbsp; Of
course, there was a lady in the case, indeed, judging by the riot
that went on all night, I am inclined to think there must have
been a dozen.&nbsp; He was certainly a fine cat, and they took to
calling for him in the day time.&nbsp; Then gentleman cats who
had been wronged took to calling also, and demanding
explanations, which Thomas Henry, to do him justice, was always
ready to accord.</p>
<p>The village boys used to loiter round all day to watch the
fights, and angry housewives would be constantly charging into
our kitchen to fling dead cats upon the table, and appeal to
Heaven and myself for justice.&nbsp; Our kitchen became a
veritable cat&rsquo;s morgue, and I had to purchase a new kitchen
table.&nbsp; The cook said it would make her work simpler if she
could keep a table entirely to herself.&nbsp; She said it quite
confused her, having so many dead cats lying round among her
joints and vegetables: she was afraid of making a mistake.&nbsp;
Accordingly, the old table was placed under the window, and
devoted to the cats; and, after that, she would never allow
anyone to bring a cat, however dead, to her table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want me to do with it,&rdquo; I heard her
asking an excited lady on one occasion; &ldquo;cook
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my cat,&rdquo; said the lady;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s what that is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not making cat pie to-day,&rdquo;
answered our cook.&nbsp; &ldquo;You take it to its proper
table.&nbsp; This is my table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first, &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; was generally satisfied with
half a crown, but as time went on cats rose.&nbsp; I had hitherto
regarded cats as a cheap commodity, and I became surprised at the
value attached to them.&nbsp; I began to think seriously of
breeding cats as an industry.&nbsp; At the prices current in that
village, I could have made an income of thousands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look what your beast has done,&rdquo; said one irate
female, to whom I had been called out in the middle of
dinner.</p>
<p>I looked.&nbsp; Thomas Henry appeared to have
&ldquo;done&rdquo; a mangy, emaciated animal, that must have been
far happier dead than alive.&nbsp; Had the poor creature been
mine I should have thanked him; but some people never know when
they are well off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; taken a five-pun&rsquo; note
for that cat,&rdquo; said the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of opinion,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;but personally I think you would have been unwise to
refuse it.&nbsp; Taking the animal as it stands, I don&rsquo;t
feel inclined to give you more than a shilling for it.&nbsp; If
you think you can do better by taking it elsewhere, you do
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was more like a Christian than a cat,&rdquo; said
the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not taking dead Christians,&rdquo; I answered
firmly, &ldquo;and even if I were I wouldn&rsquo;t give more than
a shilling for a specimen like that.&nbsp; You can consider him
as a Christian, or you can consider him as a cat; but he&rsquo;s
not worth more than a shilling in either case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We settled eventually for eighteenpence.</p>
<p>The number of cats that Thomas Henry contrived to dispose of
also surprised me.&nbsp; Quite a massacre of cats seemed to be in
progress.</p>
<p>One evening, going into the kitchen, for I made it a practice
now to visit the kitchen each evening, to inspect the daily
consignment of dead cats, I found, among others, a curiously
marked tortoiseshell cat, lying on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That cat&rsquo;s worth half a sovereign,&rdquo; said
the owner, who was standing by, drinking beer.</p>
<p>I took up the animal, and examined it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your cat killed him yesterday,&rdquo; continued the
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a burning shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cat has killed him three times,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was killed on Saturday as Mrs.
Hedger&rsquo;s cat; on Monday he was killed for Mrs. Myers.&nbsp;
I was not quite positive on Monday; but I had my suspicions, and
I made notes.&nbsp; Now I recognise him.&nbsp; You take my
advice, and bury him before he breeds a fever.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t care how many lives a cat has got; I only pay for
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We gave Thomas Henry every chance to reform; but he only went
from bad to worse, and added poaching and chicken-stalking to his
other crimes, and I grew tired of paying for his vices.</p>
<p>I consulted the gardener, and the gardener said he had known
cats taken that way before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know of any cure for it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; replied the gardener, &ldquo;I have
heard as how a dose of brickbat and pond is a good thing in a
general way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try him with a dose just before bed
time,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; The gardener administered it, and
we had no further trouble with him.</p>
<p>Poor Thomas Henry!&nbsp; It shows to one how a reputation for
respectability may lie in the mere absence of temptation.&nbsp;
Born and bred in the atmosphere of the Reform Club, what
gentleman could go wrong?&nbsp; I was sorry for Thomas Henry, and
I have never believed in the moral influence of the country
since.</p>
<h2>THE CITY OF THE SEA</h2>
<p>They say, the chroniclers who have written the history of that
low-lying, wind-swept coast, that years ago the foam fringe of
the ocean lay further to the east; so that where now the North
Sea creeps among the treacherous sand-reefs, it was once dry
land.&nbsp; In those days, between the Abbey and the sea, there
stood a town of seven towers and four rich churches, surrounded
by a wall of twelve stones&rsquo; thickness, making it, as men
reckoned then, a place of strength and much import; and the
monks, glancing their eyes downward from the Abbey garden on the
hill, saw beneath their feet its narrow streets, gay with the
ever passing of rich merchandise, saw its many wharves and
water-ways, ever noisy with the babel of strange tongues, saw its
many painted masts, wagging their grave heads above the dormer
roofs and quaintly-carved oak gables.</p>
<p>Thus the town prospered till there came a night when it did
evil in the sight of God and man.&nbsp; Those were troublous
times to Saxon dwellers by the sea, for the Danish water-rats
swarmed round each river mouth, scenting treasure from afar; and
by none was the white flash of their sharp, strong teeth more
often seen than by the men of Eastern Anglia, and by none in
Eastern Anglia more often than by the watchers on the walls of
the town of seven towers that once stood upon the dry land, but
which now lies twenty fathom deep below the waters.&nbsp; Many a
bloody fight raged now without and now within its wall of twelve
stones&rsquo; thickness.&nbsp; Many a groan of dying man, many a
shriek of murdered woman, many a wail of mangled child, knocked
at the Abbey door upon its way to Heaven, calling the
trembling-monks from their beds, to pray for the souls that were
passing by.</p>
<p>But at length peace came to the long-troubled land: Dane and
Saxon agreeing to dwell in friendship side by side, East Anglia
being wide, and there being room for both.&nbsp; And all men
rejoiced greatly, for all were weary of a strife in which little
had been gained on either side beyond hard blows, and their
thoughts were of the ingle-nook.&nbsp; So the long-bearded Danes,
their thirsty axes harmless on their backs, passed to and fro in
straggling bands, seeking where undisturbed and undisturbing they
might build their homes; and thus it came about that Haafager and
his company, as the sun was going down, drew near to the town of
seven towers, that in those days stood on dry land between the
Abbey and the sea.</p>
<p>And the men of the town, seeing the Danes, opened wide their
gates saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have fought, but now there is peace.&nbsp; Enter,
and make merry with us, and to-morrow go your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Haafager made answer:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am an old man, I pray you do not take my words
amiss.&nbsp; There is peace between us, as you say, and we thank
you for your courtesy, but the stains are still fresh upon our
swords.&nbsp; Let us camp here without your walls, and a little
later, when the grass has grown upon the fields where we have
striven, and our young men have had time to forget, we will make
merry together, as men should who dwell side by side in the same
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the men of the town still urged Haafager, calling his
people neighbours; and the Abbot, who had hastened down, fearing
there might be strife, added his words to theirs,
saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass in, my children.&nbsp; Let there indeed be peace
between you, that the blessing of God may be upon the land, and
upon both Dane and Saxon&rdquo;; for the Abbot saw that the
townsmen were well disposed towards the Danes, and knew that men,
when they have feasted and drunk together, think kinder of one
another.</p>
<p>Then answered Haafager, who knew the Abbot for a holy
man:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold up your staff, my father, that the shadow of the
cross your people worship may fall upon our path, so we will pass
into the town and there shall be peace between us, for though
your gods are not our gods, faith between man and man is of all
altars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Abbot held his staff aloft between Haafager&rsquo;s
people and the sun, it being fashioned in the form of a cross,
and under its shadow the Danes passed by into the town of seven
towers, there being of them, with the women and the children,
nearly two thousand souls, and the gates were made fast behind
them.</p>
<p>So they who had fought face to face, feasted side by side,
pledging one another in the wine cup, as was the custom; and
Haafager&rsquo;s men, knowing themselves amongst friends, cast
aside their arms, and when the feast was done, being weary, they
lay down to sleep.</p>
<p>Then an evil voice arose in the town, and said: &ldquo;Who are
these that have come among us to share our land?&nbsp; Are not
the stones of our streets red with the blood of wife and child
that they have slain?&nbsp; Do men let the wolf go free when they
have trapped him with meat?&nbsp; Let us fall upon them now that
they are heavy with food and wine, so that not one of them shall
escape.&nbsp; Thus no further harm shall come to us from them nor
from their children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the voice of evil prevailed, and the men of the town of
seven towers fell upon the Danes with whom they had broken meat,
even to the women and the little children; and the blood of the
people of Haafager cried with a loud voice at the Abbey door,
through the long night it cried, saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trusted in your spoken word.&nbsp; I broke meat with
you.&nbsp; I put my faith in you and in your God.&nbsp; I passed
beneath the shadow of your cross to enter your doors.&nbsp; Let
your God make answer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor was there silence till the dawn.</p>
<p>Then the Abbot rose from where he knelt and called to God,
saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast heard, O God.&nbsp; Make answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there came a great sound from the sea as though a tongue
had been given to the deep, so that the monks fell upon their
knees in fear; but the Abbot answered:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the voice of God speaking through the
waters.&nbsp; He hath made answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that winter a mighty storm arose, the like of which no man
had known before; for the sea was piled upon the dry land until
the highest tower of the town of seven towers was not more high;
and the waters moved forward over the dry land.&nbsp; And the men
of the town of seven towers fled from the oncoming of the waters,
but the waters overtook them so that not one of them
escaped.&nbsp; And the town of the seven towers and of the four
churches, and of the many streets and quays, was buried
underneath the waters, and the feet of the waters still moved
till they came to the hill whereon the Abbey stood.&nbsp; Then
the Abbot prayed to God that the waters might be stayed, and God
heard, and the sea came no farther.</p>
<p>And that this tale is true, and not a fable made by the
weavers of words, he who doubts may know from the fisher-folk,
who to-day ply their calling amongst the reefs and sandbanks of
that lonely coast.&nbsp; For there are those among them who,
peering from the bows of their small craft, have seen far down
beneath their keels a city of strange streets and many
quays.&nbsp; But as to this, I, who repeat these things to you,
cannot speak of my own knowledge, for this city of the sea is
only visible when a rare wind, blowing from the north, sweeps the
shadows from the waves; and though on many a sunny day I have
drifted where its seven towers should once have stood, yet for me
that wind has never blown, pushing back the curtains of the sea,
and, therefore, I have strained my eyes in vain.</p>
<p>But this I do know, that the rumbling stones of that ancient
Abbey, between which and the foam fringe of the ocean the town of
seven towers once lay, now stand upon a wave-washed cliff, and
that he who looks forth from its shattered mullions to-day sees
only the marshland and the wrinkled waters, hears only the plaint
of the circling gulls and the weary crying of the sea.</p>
<p>And that God&rsquo;s anger is not everlasting, and that the
evil that there is in men shall be blotted out, he who doubts may
also learn from the wisdom of the simple fisher-folk, who dwell
about the borders of the marsh-land; for they will tell him that
on stormy nights there speaks a deep voice from the sea, calling
the dead monks to rise from their forgotten graves, and chant a
mass for the souls of the men of the town of seven towers.&nbsp;
Clothed in long glittering white, they move with slowly pacing
feet around the Abbey&rsquo;s grass-grown aisles, and the music
of their prayers is heard above the screaming of the storm.&nbsp;
And to this I also can bear witness, for I have seen the passing
of their shrouded forms behind the blackness of the shattered
shafts; I have heard their sweet, sad singing above the wailing
of the wind.</p>
<p>Thus for many ages have the dead monks prayed that the men of
the town of seven towers may be forgiven.&nbsp; Thus, for many
ages yet shall they so pray, till the day come when of their once
fair Abbey not a single stone shall stand upon its fellow; and in
that day it shall be known that the anger of God against the men
of the town of seven towers has passed away; and in that day the
feet of the waters shall move back, and the town of seven towers
shall stand again upon the dry land.</p>
<p>There be some, I know, who say that this is but a legend; who
will tell you that the shadowy shapes that you may see with your
own eyes on stormy nights, waving their gleaming arms behind the
ruined buttresses are but of phosphorescent foam, tossed by the
raging waves above the cliffs; and that the sweet, sad harmony
cleaving the trouble of the night is but the &aelig;olian music
of the wind.</p>
<p>But such are of the blind, who see only with their eyes.&nbsp;
For myself I see the white-robed monks, and hear the chanting of
their mass for the souls of the sinful men of the town of seven
towers.&nbsp; For it has been said that when an evil deed is
done, a prayer is born to follow it through time into eternity,
and plead for it.&nbsp; Thus is the whole world clasped around
with folded hands both of the dead and of the living, as with a
shield, lest the shafts of God&rsquo;s anger should consume
it.</p>
<p>Therefore, I know that the good monks of this nameless Abbey
are still praying that the sin of those they love may be
forgiven.</p>
<p>God grant good men may say a mass for us.</p>

<p>MR. TRAVERS.</p>
<p>MRS. TRAVERS.</p>
<p>MARION [their daughter].</p>
<p>DAN [a gentleman of no position].</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>SCENE: A room opening upon a garden.&nbsp; The shadows creep
from their corners, driving before them the fading twilight.</p>
<p>MRS. TRAVERS sits in a wickerwork easy chair.&nbsp; MR.
TRAVERS, smoking a cigar, sits the other side of the room.&nbsp;
MARION stands by the open French window, looking out.</p>
<p>MR. TRAVERS.&nbsp; Nice little place Harry&rsquo;s got down
here.</p>
<p>MRS. TRAVERS.&nbsp; Yes; I should keep this on if I were you,
Marion.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll find it very handy.&nbsp; One can
entertain so cheaply up the river; one is not expected to make
much of a show.&nbsp; [She turns to her husband.]&nbsp; Your poor
cousin Emily used to work off quite half her list that
way&mdash;relations and Americans, and those sort of people, you
know&mdash;at that little place of theirs at Goring.&nbsp; You
remember it&mdash;a poky hole I always thought it, but it had a
lot of green stuff over the door&mdash;looked very pretty from
the other side of the river.&nbsp; She always used to have cold
meat and pickles for lunch&mdash;called it a picnic.&nbsp; People
said it was so homely and simple.</p>
<p>MR. TRAVERS.&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t stop long, I
remember.</p>
<p>MRS. TRAVERS.&nbsp; And there was a special champagne she
always kept for the river&mdash;only twenty-five shillings a
dozen, I think she told me she paid for it, and very good it was
too, for the price.&nbsp; That old Indian major&mdash;what was
his name?&mdash;said it suited him better than anything else he
had ever tried.&nbsp; He always used to drink a tumblerful before
breakfast; such a funny thing to do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve often
wondered where she got it.</p>
<p>MR. TRAVERS.&nbsp; So did most people who tasted it.&nbsp;
Marion wants to forget those lessons, not learn them.&nbsp; She
is going to marry a rich man who will be able to entertain his
guests decently.</p>
<p>MRS. TRAVERS.&nbsp; Oh, well, James, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;
None of us can afford to live up to the income we want people to
think we&rsquo;ve got.&nbsp; One must economise somewhere.&nbsp;
A pretty figure we should cut in the county if I didn&rsquo;t
know how to make fivepence look like a shilling.&nbsp; And,
besides, there are certain people that one has to be civil to,
that, at the same time, one doesn&rsquo;t want to introduce into
one&rsquo;s regular circle.&nbsp; If you take my advice, Marion,
you won&rsquo;t encourage those sisters of Harry&rsquo;s more
than you can help.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re dear sweet girls, and you
can be very nice to them; but don&rsquo;t have them too much
about.&nbsp; Their manners are terribly old-fashioned, and
they&rsquo;ve no notion how to dress, and those sort of people
let down the tone of a house.</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not likely to have many &ldquo;dear
sweet girls&rdquo; on my visiting list.&nbsp; [With a
laugh.]&nbsp; There will hardly be enough in common to make the
company desired, on either side.</p>
<p>MRS. TRAVERS.&nbsp; Well, I only want you to be careful, my
dear.&nbsp; So much depends on how you begin, and with prudence
there&rsquo;s really no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t do very
well.&nbsp; I suppose there&rsquo;s no doubt about Harry&rsquo;s
income.&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t object to a few inquiries?</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; I think you may trust me to see to that,
mamma.&nbsp; It would be a bad bargain for me, if even the cash
were not certain.</p>
<p>MR. TRAVERS [jumping up].&nbsp; Oh, I do wish you women
wouldn&rsquo;t discuss the matter in that horribly business-like
way.&nbsp; One would think the girl was selling herself.</p>
<p>MRS. TRAVERS.&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t be foolish, James.&nbsp;
One must look at the practical side of these things.&nbsp;
Marriage is a matter of sentiment to a man&mdash;very proper that
it should be.&nbsp; A woman has to remember that she&rsquo;s
fixing her position for life.</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; You see, papa dear, it&rsquo;s her one
venture.&nbsp; If she doesn&rsquo;t sell herself to advantage
then, she doesn&rsquo;t get another opportunity&mdash;very
easily.</p>
<p>MR. TRAVERS.&nbsp; Umph!&nbsp; When I was a young man, girls
talked more about love and less about income.</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; Perhaps they had not our educational
advantages.</p>
<p>[DAN enters from the garden.&nbsp; He is a man of a little
over forty, his linen somewhat frayed about the edges.]</p>
<p>MRS. TRAVERS.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; We were just wondering where all
you people had got to.</p>
<p>DAN.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been out sailing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been
sent up to fetch you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s delightful on the
river.&nbsp; The moon is just rising.</p>
<p>MRS. TRAVERS.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s so cold.</p>
<p>MR. TRAVERS.&nbsp; Oh, never mind the cold.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
many a long year since you and I looked at the moon
together.&nbsp; It will do us good.</p>
<p>MRS. TRAVERS.&nbsp; Ah, dear.&nbsp; Boys will be boys.&nbsp;
Give me my wrap then.</p>
<p>[DAN places it about her.&nbsp; They move towards the window,
where they stand talking.&nbsp; MARION has slipped out and
returns with her father&rsquo;s cap.&nbsp; He takes her face
between his hands and looks at her.]</p>
<p>MR. TRAVERS.&nbsp; Do you really care for Harry, Marion?</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; As much as one can care for a man with five
thousand a year.&nbsp; Perhaps he will make it ten one
day&mdash;then I shall care for him twice as much.&nbsp;
[Laughs.]</p>
<p>MR. TRAVERS.&nbsp; And are you content with this marriage?</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; Quite.</p>
<p>[He shakes his head gravely at her.]</p>
<p>MRS. TRAVERS.&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t you coming, Marion?</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m feeling tired.</p>
<p>[MR. and MRS. TRAVERS go out.]</p>
<p>DAN.&nbsp; Are you going to leave Harry alone with two pairs
of lovers?</p>
<p>MARION [with a laugh].&nbsp; Yes&mdash;let him see how
ridiculous they look.&nbsp; I hate the night&mdash;it follows you
and asks questions.&nbsp; Shut it out.&nbsp; Come and talk to
me.&nbsp; Amuse me.</p>
<p>DAN.&nbsp; What shall I talk to you about?</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; Oh, tell me all the news.&nbsp; What is the
world doing?&nbsp; Who has run away with whose wife?&nbsp; Who
has been swindling whom?&nbsp; Which philanthropist has been
robbing the poor?&nbsp; What saint has been discovered
sinning?&nbsp; What is the latest scandal?&nbsp; Who has been
found out? and what is it they have been doing? and what is
everybody saying about it?</p>
<p>DAN.&nbsp; Would it amuse you?</p>
<p>MARION [she sits by the piano, softly touching the keys, idly
recalling many memories].&nbsp; What should it do?&nbsp; Make me
weep?&nbsp; Should not one be glad to know one&rsquo;s friends
better?</p>
<p>DAN.&nbsp; I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t be clever.&nbsp; Everyone
one meets is clever nowadays.&nbsp; It came in when the
sun-flower went out.&nbsp; I preferred the sun-flower; it was
more amusing.</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; And stupid people, I suppose, will come in when
the clever people go out.&nbsp; I prefer the clever.&nbsp; They
have better manners.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re exceedingly
disagreeable.&nbsp; [She leaves the piano, and, throwing herself
upon the couch, takes up a book.]</p>
<p>DAN.&nbsp; I know I am.&nbsp; The night has been with me
also.&nbsp; It follows one and asks questions.</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; What questions has it been asking you?</p>
<p>DAN.&nbsp; Many&mdash;and so many of them have no
answer.&nbsp; Why am I a useless, drifting log upon the
world&rsquo;s tide?&nbsp; Why have all the young men passed
me?&nbsp; Why am I, at thirty-nine, let us say, with brain, with
power, with strength&mdash;nobody thinks I am worth anything, but
I am&mdash;I know it.&nbsp; I might have been an able editor,
devoting every morning from ten till three to arranging the
affairs of the Universe, or a popular politician, trying to
understand what I was talking about, and to believe it.&nbsp; And
what am I?&nbsp; A newspaper reporter, at three-ha&rsquo;pence a
line&mdash;I beg their pardon, its occasionally twopence.</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; Does it matter?</p>
<p>DAN.&nbsp; Does it matter!&nbsp; Does it matter whether a
Union Jack or a Tricolor floats over the turrets of Badajoz? yet
we pour our blood into its ditches to decide the argument.&nbsp;
Does it matter whether one star more or less is marked upon our
charts? yet we grow blind peering into their depths.&nbsp; Does
it matter that one keel should slip through the grip of the Polar
ice? yet nearer, nearer to it, we pile our whitening bones.&nbsp;
And it&rsquo;s worth playing, the game of life.&nbsp; And
there&rsquo;s a meaning in it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s worth playing, if
only that it strengthens the muscles of our souls.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d like to have taken a hand in it.</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>DAN.&nbsp; No partner.&nbsp; Dull playing by oneself.&nbsp; No
object.</p>
<p>MARION [after a silence].&nbsp; What was she like?</p>
<p>DAN.&nbsp; So like you that there are times when I almost wish
I had never met you.&nbsp; You set me thinking about myself, and
that is a subject I find it pleasanter to forget.</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; And this woman that was like me&mdash;she could
have made a man&rsquo;s life?</p>
<p>DAN.&nbsp; Ay!</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you tell me about her?&nbsp; Had she
many faults?</p>
<p>DAN.&nbsp; Enough to love her by.</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; But she must have been good.</p>
<p>DAN.&nbsp; Good enough to be a woman.</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; That might mean so much or so little.</p>
<p>DAN.&nbsp; It should mean much to my thinking.&nbsp; There are
few women.</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; Few!&nbsp; I thought the economists held that
there were too many of us.</p>
<p>DAN.&nbsp; Not enough&mdash;not enough to go round.&nbsp; That
is why a true woman has many lovers.</p>
<p>[There is a silence between them.&nbsp; Then MARION rises, but
their eyes do not meet.]</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; How serious we have grown!</p>
<p>DAN.&nbsp; They say a dialogue between a man and woman always
does.</p>
<p>MARION [she moves away, then, hesitating, half returns].&nbsp;
May I ask you a question?</p>
<p>DAN.&nbsp; That is an easy favour to grant.</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; If&mdash;if at any time you felt regard again
for a woman, would you, for her sake, if she wished it, seek to
gain, even now, that position in the world which is your
right&mdash;which would make her proud of your
friendship&mdash;would make her feel that even her life had not
been altogether without purpose?</p>
<p>DAN.&nbsp; Too late!&nbsp; The old hack can only look over the
hedge, and watch the field race by.&nbsp; The old ambition stirs
within me at times&mdash;especially after a glass of good
wine&mdash;and Harry&rsquo;s wine&mdash;God bless him&mdash;is
excellent&mdash;but to-morrow morning&mdash;[with a shrug of his
shoulders he finishes his meaning].</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; Then she could do nothing?</p>
<p>DAN.&nbsp; Nothing for his fortunes&mdash;much for
himself.&nbsp; My dear young lady, never waste pity on a man in
love&mdash;nor upon a child crying for the moon.&nbsp; The moon
is a good thing to cry for.</p>
<p>MARION.&nbsp; I am glad I am like her.&nbsp; I am glad that I
have met you.</p>
<p>[She gives him her hand, and for a moment he holds it.&nbsp;
Then she goes out.]</p>
<p>[A flower has fallen from her breast, whether by chance or
meaning, he knows not.&nbsp; He picks it up and kisses it; stands
twirling it, undecided for a second, then lets it fall again upon
the floor.]</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
